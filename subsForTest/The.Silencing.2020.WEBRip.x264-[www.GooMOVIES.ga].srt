That badge don't mean shit
out here, lady.

360
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:47,280
Is Sam Moonblood around?

361
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:49,014
He's probably huntin'.

362
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,250
[Gustafson]
Oh, yeah? Whereabouts?

363
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:53,119
Shut your cock-hole, Patty.

364
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,822
Does Sam Moonblood use atlatls
when he hunts?

365
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:58,391
What are you getting at?

366
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:02,794
We hear things out here too,
you know.

367
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:05,265
Sam's a lot of things...

368
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:06,832
but he ain't a killer.

369
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:11,837
You tell Sam Moonblood
I'm looking for him.

370
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,174
Fucking dick.

371
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:15,807
[laughter, chatter]

372
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:39,332
[pounding on window]

373
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,069
Oh, shit.

374
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:48,208
Moonblood has a place
over in Sawbill.

375
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,908
You'll find him there.

376
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,977
Thank you, Patty.

377
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,415
Look after yourself.

378
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:18,438
[breathing heavily]

379
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:22,941
[groans]

380
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:58,077
[hollow thudding]

381
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:33,179
[softly]
What the...

382
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,283
[whispers] Hey. Hey.

383
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:40,286
Hey.

384
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,523
[grunts]

385
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:46,125
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

386
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,361
Hey, hey, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

387
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:50,430
I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

388
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:52,365
Listen to me, okay?

389
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,334
Let me help you.

390
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,102
I want to help you.

391
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,403
Okay?

392
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:58,904
Let me show you.

393
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,239
Please.

394
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,875
[wind whistling]

395
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:07,213
It's gonna be a lot warmer
down there out of the wind.

396
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,981
We don't go down there,
we'll freeze.

397
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:13,052
Please.

398
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,986
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

399
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:36,041
Here.

400
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,410
Hold this.

401
00:38:37,443 --> 00:38:39,010
- [glass breaking]
- Shit.

402
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:43,048
Goddamn it.

403
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,052
Oh, come on.

404
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,919
No, no, no, no, no.

405
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:49,955
Oh, no, you got
to be kid...

406
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:53,092
- Oh, no. Shit!
- [shards clatter]

407
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,428
My whiskey.

408
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:57,263
[breathing heavily]

409
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:07,440
My ex-wife used to call me
abrasive.

410
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:11,677
I think I understand
what she meant now.

411
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:15,081
I'm sorry.

412
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,685
This is a pitfall.

413
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,287
For trapping animals.

414
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:28,960
This is a real
nasty way to go.

415
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,397
There's a few of these
old traps around,

416
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:33,266
but I don't use 'em anymore.

417
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:39,405
[grunts]

418
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:46,412
Okay...

419
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:50,616
I'm just going
to put these on you, okay?

420
00:39:57,723 --> 00:40:00,092
Okay, there you go.

421
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:04,363
Can you talk?

422
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,433
No.

423
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:09,068
My name's Rayburn.

424
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,244
M...

425
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:19,412
O...

426
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:24,217
Molly. Molly.

427
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,753
It's nice to know you, Molly.

428
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,692
Do you know
who that man is?

429
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,595
No?

430
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:44,237
Try and get
some sleep, okay?

431
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,205
We got a long walk
tomorrow.

432
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:49,075
[sighs]

433
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:00,653
It's going to be okay.

434
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:10,696
[engine turns off]

435
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:25,278
- [knock on door]
- Sam Moonblood?

436
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,238
[loud thump]

437
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:01,207
[creaking]

438
00:43:21,694 --> 00:43:23,696
- Freeze!
- Whoa, easy!

439
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,665
It's me, Alice.

440
00:43:25,698 --> 00:43:27,600
Holy shit.

441
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:29,468
[breathing heavily]

442
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:33,739
[Blackhawk] Followed you
and called you in.

443
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:35,941
Jesus Christ.
Breaking and entering?

444
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,443
[Gustafson]
It was an urgent matter.

445
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:38,844
Yeah, well, you need
a warrant, Sheriff.

446
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:40,513
Probable cause.

447
00:43:40,546 --> 00:43:41,914
Moonblood's tracks
are all over this.

448
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:43,749
We know that the suspect
used an atlatl,

449
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,685
and he has atlatls
in his fucking basement,

450
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:48,320
and the spearhead
has an MB on it.

451
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,756
And no one knows
where the hell he is.

452
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,292
Does your brother
own an atlatl?

453
00:43:57,363 --> 00:43:58,764
Young girl missing.

454
00:43:58,798 --> 00:44:00,966
Now, the mother hangs out
at the Factory.

455
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,470
Said she got in an altercation
a few nights back with a man

456
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:06,238
she named Brooks.

457
00:44:07,473 --> 00:44:10,309
- What are you trying to say?
- He was getting handsy with her.

458
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:12,445
He wouldn't leave,
so Sam Moonblood tossed him out.

459
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:14,380
My brother would never
kidnap a young girl.

460
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:19,318
We never know as much
as we think we do, Alice.

461
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,953
Now, I know your brother
went through some hard times

462
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:22,722
after your parents passed...

463
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:25,257
There's nothing wrong
with my brother.

464
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,827
- Then bring him in.
- Are you forgetting who the sheriff is?

465
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,529
There is no sheriff here.

466
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:32,898
This is Sawbill nation.

467
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,409
[Rayburn]
We make quite a pair, kid.

468
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:45,010
[panting]

469
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:49,982
My place is southwest of here,

470
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:53,018
probably six miles.

471
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,381
[knock on door]

472
00:45:22,414 --> 00:45:24,550
Hey. Hey, it's me.

473
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:26,952
Brooks?

474
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:54,547
[sighs]

475
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:04,490
[grunts softly]

476
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:07,026
[panting]

477
00:46:09,129 --> 00:46:10,663
I need a break.

478
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,901
[breathing heavily]

479
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,046
It's not much further.

480
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:31,784
[groans]

481
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:33,552
I need a drink.

482
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:45,898
I bet your mom and dad
will be real happy to see you.

483
00:46:52,138 --> 00:46:55,407
I lost my daughter too.

484
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,577
On my watch.

485
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:04,150
You know what?
You might...

486
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:05,851
maybe...

487
00:47:05,885 --> 00:47:07,453
yeah.

488
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:11,824
Open it.

489
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,405
You recognize her?

490
00:47:41,054 --> 00:47:42,155
Let's go.

491
00:47:49,795 --> 00:47:51,630
[man, over police scanner]
<i>Sheriff, copy a call.</i>

492
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:53,565
<i>My brothers are complaining</i>

493
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,467
<i>Rayburn Swanson confiscated
their rifles.</i>

494
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,036
<i>Can you go check it out?</i>

495
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:25,564
Take a seat.

496
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:27,533
[door closes]

497
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:29,468

498
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:37,776
[sighs]

499
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:42,182
Let me get you some water.

500
00:48:46,252 --> 00:48:47,720
[dog whimpers]

501
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:52,058
Thor?

502
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:53,859
[scratching and whining]

503
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,135
[grunts]

504
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,602
[gasps]

505
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,909
Who are you?

506
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,544
Who are you?

507
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:00,193
[Rayburn yelling]

508
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:02,995

[shotgun clicks empty]

- [racking shotgun]
- [clicks empty]

512

[breathing heavily]

513
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:39,598

[vehicle approaches]

515
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:14,167
Rayburn?

516
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,902
Rayburn,
it's Sheriff Gustafson.

517
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:20,073
I'm here about
those guns you took.

518
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:22,040
Do you have a moment to talk?

519
00:51:41,494 --> 00:51:42,828
[shotgun racks]

520
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:44,130
Put your gun down!

521
00:51:44,164 --> 00:51:46,199
I said put your gun down!

522
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:48,901
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Put your gun down, goddamn it!

523
00:51:48,934 --> 00:51:50,869
- He's still here. He's here!
- What have you done?

524
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,804
- What have you done?
- What? No, no, no, no, no!

525
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:55,974
- What have you done?
- Sheriff! Behind you, behind you!

526
00:51:56,008 --> 00:51:57,809
Drop your weapon!

527
00:51:57,843 --> 00:51:59,445
Drop your weapon
and get on your knees!

528
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,214
Now!

529
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:02,714
Do it now!

530
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,452

531
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:09,721
- Oh, my God.
- Put your hands on your head, now!

532
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:14,060
[Rayburn]
Sheriff.

533
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:18,064

You got to be careful.

[audio fades and distorts]

538
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,143

00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,353
[Rayburn gasping]

543
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:43,989
Go, Brooks.

544
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,225
Go home.

545
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:46,492
[grunts]

546
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:57,803
Rayburn?

547
00:53:03,909 --> 00:53:05,811
[door opens]

548
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:03,001
- [metallic snap]
- [screams]

549
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,537
- [groaning]
- [Gustafson] Help!

550
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:10,008
Hello? Hello?

551
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,844
[man, on radio] <i>This is dispatch.
Identify, please.</i>

552
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:17,049
I need an ambulance at
Rayburn Swanson's immediately.

553
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:21,454
A girl is hurt real bad.

554
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:22,921
Rayburn Swanson's.

555
00:54:24,022 --> 00:54:26,092
[engine starts]

556
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:36,602
Karl.

557
00:54:36,636 --> 00:54:38,304
[Rayburn grunts]

558
00:54:40,206 --> 00:54:42,108
[gasps and groans]

559
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:44,042
Ray?

560
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:45,278
What happened?

561
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:47,146
It's Gustafson.

562
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,348
She fucking shot me.

563
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,616
What? Why?

564
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,152
She's protecting Brooks.

565
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:54,354
He did it.

566
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,390
We need to get you
to a hospital.

567
00:54:57,423 --> 00:55:01,194
No, no, no.
They'll be looking for me.

568
00:55:01,227 --> 00:55:04,630
I need checkpoints on every road
in and out of this county.

569
00:55:04,664 --> 00:55:06,965
- You hear me?
- Yes. She's coming with you.

570
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:12,572
[groans]

571
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:19,579
[sighs]

572
00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:25,618
What the fuck have I done?

573
00:55:26,985 --> 00:55:28,654
[police siren wailing]

574
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:30,356
[police dispatcher]
<i>All units, all units.</i>

575
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,126
<i>Be on the lookout
for Rayburn Swanson.</i>

576
00:55:35,428 --> 00:55:36,629
[Debbie]
It's okay, just hold on.

577
00:55:36,662 --> 00:55:38,398
No.

578
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:40,233
[Debbie] Hold on,
we're going to be there soon.

579
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:41,667
Hang in there, buddy.

580
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:44,670
I'm sorry.

581
00:55:47,173 --> 00:55:48,341
What?

582
00:55:48,374 --> 00:55:50,309
You're not too old...

583
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:53,044
to be a mother again.

584
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:54,180
You deserve it.

585
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:57,183
I'm sorry I wasn't
a better father.

586
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:59,218
Just stop. It's okay.

587
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:03,189
And, Karl,
you're a good man.

588
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,460
You're just saying that because
you think you're dying.

589
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,328
Don't worry, we can go back
to hating each other

590
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:11,364
after you're all stitched up.

591
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:25,077
Thanks for coming, Doctor.
I appreciate it.

592
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:27,513
- Where is he?
- He's over here.

593
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:29,148
Jesus.

594
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:33,519
[Blackhawk]
It's the best I could do, doc.

595
00:56:33,553 --> 00:56:35,254
[sighs]

596
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:36,456
[door opens]

597
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:38,057
Okay, this is it.

598
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,226
He's here.
This is Dr. Boone.

599
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:42,195
[Rayburn]
We met at the morgue.

600
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:44,297
I hope you don't plan
on taking me there, Doc.

601
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,132
What in the hell
did you get yourself into?

602
00:56:46,165 --> 00:56:48,434
I came across
the wrong kind of man.

603
00:56:48,468 --> 00:56:50,203
Or woman, I guess.

604
00:56:50,236 --> 00:56:52,003
He needs a hospital,
not a fucking RV.

605
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:54,005
I have emergency supplies,
including blood bags.

606
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,141
Please?

607
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:58,511
[Blackhawk]
We have no choice, Doc.

608
00:56:58,544 --> 00:57:00,112
I'll see what I can do.

609
00:57:00,146 --> 00:57:01,581
I need some space.

610
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:03,216
Okay. Yeah.

611
00:57:03,249 --> 00:57:04,517
[Boone]
Okay.

612
00:57:19,765 --> 00:57:21,267
He'll be okay,
all right?

613
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,535
Okay.

614
00:57:25,605 --> 00:57:27,173
Do me a favor,

615
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:29,609
go back to the car
and lock the doors, okay?

616
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:31,143
Be careful.

617
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:38,251
Yeah, this is Blackhawk.

618
00:57:38,284 --> 00:57:40,219
I need backup
at the Factory right now.

619
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:51,364
Hey.

620
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:54,300
Can I get some?

621
00:57:57,203 --> 00:57:58,604
[Blackhawk]
Brooks!

622
00:57:58,638 --> 00:58:00,540
Hey, come here!

623
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:03,709
Brooks! Hey!

624
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:21,494
Brooks!

625
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:23,796
Brooks! Stop!

626
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:25,831
[police sirens blurt]

627
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:33,439
Get back
or I'll fucking kill him.

628
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,741
- Okay. Stay calm.
- Move the cars or I'll kill him.

629
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:39,211
Hey, take it easy, Brooks.
Let's just think this thing through here.

630
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:40,713
This isn't just my fault, okay?

631
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,148
I didn't start any of it!

632
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:43,616
Hey, I understand.

633
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:45,685
But you have the power
to put an end to this.

634
00:58:45,718 --> 00:58:48,654
So why don't you just put that
down and we'll talk, okay?

635
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:51,324
Brooks, we're just trying to help
Rayburn here. He's seriously hurt.

636
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:53,125
You can help him
when we're on the road, okay?

637
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,393
Just move the cars...

638
00:58:54,427 --> 00:58:57,563
Come here.

639
00:58:57,597 --> 00:58:59,432
Put your hands
behind your back.

640
00:58:59,465 --> 00:59:01,601
Hey, hey, hey. Easy. Easy.

641
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:12,178
Did they find Rayburn?

642
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:13,646
Your brother's
been arrested.

643
00:59:27,426 --> 00:59:28,728
[Gustafson]
Hey.

644
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:30,563
- Where is he?
- Take it easy.

645
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:31,864
I want to talk to him.

646
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:33,566
Where is he?

647
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,302
Did you shoot
Rayburn Swanson?

648
00:59:37,737 --> 00:59:40,706
That is an ongoing investigation
in my county.

649
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,908
It has nothing
to do with you.

650
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:45,911
I want to talk to my fucking
brother, goddamn it.

651
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,582
No. This is not
your county, Alice.

652
00:59:49,615 --> 00:59:51,917
Now, your brother
wants to come clean.

653
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:53,786
Says he has something
to show us.

654
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:05,765
[police siren wailing]

655
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:17,476
Over there.

656
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:36,829
[Blackhawk]
Shit.

657
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,266
Call a paramedic.

658
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:47,273
[no audio]

659
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:55,448
- [Gustafson] <i>Who is he?</i>
- [Blackhawk] <i>Sam Moonblood.</i>

660
01:00:55,481 --> 01:00:57,016
After the altercation
at the Factory,

661
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:59,285
your brother jumped him
in the parking lot.

662
01:00:59,318 --> 01:01:01,620
Been keeping him here
ever since.

663
01:01:01,654 --> 01:01:04,690
Brooks says he doesn't know
anything about Molly Johnson.

664
01:01:04,724 --> 01:01:06,358
I believe him.

665
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:09,328
Several eyewitnesses place him
at the Factory

666
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:12,598
around the same time you
and Rayburn had your encounter.

667
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:16,736
So whoever was out there
with you, it ain't Brooks.

668
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:19,972
I'm going to recommend
you be placed on leave

669
01:01:20,005 --> 01:01:21,941
while you're investigated.

670
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:26,512
[officer]
We got pics of this already.

671
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:40,860
I'm sorry, Alice.

672
01:01:42,428 --> 01:01:43,562
I got angry.

673
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:47,333
But I had nothing
to do with those girls.

674
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:53,939
Hey.

675
01:01:53,973 --> 01:01:56,442
You know I came back for you?

676
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,678
You know that, right?

677
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,456
- [Blackhawk] Better go, Alice.
- [car door opens]

678
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:18,597
[engine starts]

679
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,382
Rayburn didn't kill
those girls.

680
01:02:40,553 --> 01:02:43,022
[Rayburn] Well,
thanks for saving my life.

681
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:45,457
I think
you saved mine too.

682
01:02:50,763 --> 01:02:52,464
They got him, right?

683
01:02:55,968 --> 01:02:57,436
What?

684
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,038
Karl says it wasn't Brooks.

685
01:03:01,006 --> 01:03:03,076
He says the timelines
don't match.

686
01:03:47,686 --> 01:03:49,622
[door closes]

687
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:54,460
[sighs]

688
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,965
[groans]

689
01:04:22,155 --> 01:04:23,789
[grunts]

690
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:03,929
[dispatcher] <i>Sheriff,
we got a call from Sawbill Reservation.</i>

691
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:06,632
<i>Blackhawk wants to see you
at the Factory ASAP.</i>

692
01:05:06,665 --> 01:05:07,933
<i>Over and out.</i>

693
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:41,201
Funny, Rayburn changed
his story.

694
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:43,869
Said that it was the suspect
that must have shot him.

695
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:47,906
We all make mistakes.

696
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,242
Yeah.

697
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:52,212
Let me do the talking, okay?

698
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,215
<i>We got one lead.</i>

699
01:05:55,248 --> 01:05:58,751
Whoever this guy is likely
bought an atlatl from you.

700
01:05:58,784 --> 01:06:02,921
I'm not the only one in America
who makes atlatls.

701
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:05,958
Who you been selling to
in the past year or so?

702
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:07,893
Can't be too many.

703
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,130
[Gustafson]
Look...

704
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,268
I'm really sorry about what
my brother did to you, okay?

705
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:17,770
He's going to get
what's coming to him.

706
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:20,939
But right now, there's someone
out there killing teenage girls,

707
01:06:20,973 --> 01:06:22,308
and we need you to talk to us.

708
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:28,314
[Sam]
I don't got names.

709
01:06:28,348 --> 01:06:30,049
Only faces.

710
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,617
I don't keep receipts,

711
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,786
'cause nobody
returns my atlatls.

712
01:06:33,819 --> 01:06:35,621
Now, if you got mug shots,
maybe I can help you,

713
01:06:35,654 --> 01:06:37,790
but if not,
you're shit out of luck.

714
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,702
That's a good spear.

715
01:06:50,736 --> 01:06:52,072
It's made from pine.

716
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:53,806
I only use birch.

717
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,808
I don't mark my spears.

718
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:58,010
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

719
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:04,750

Can't go one day, Dad?

Hi, Molly.

Can I help you?

No.

Nice truck.

747
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,931
I need to see
the autopsy report.

Is your son home?

754

No one here but me.

755
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:57,490
Well, it's just...

756
01:14:58,891 --> 01:15:01,561
last week this guy helped
jump-start my truck.

757
01:15:01,594 --> 01:15:03,663
I could've sworn this was
the truck he was driving.

758
01:15:03,696 --> 01:15:05,331
Just wanted to thank him.

759
01:15:05,364 --> 01:15:06,732
- Sorry about that.
- Oh.

760
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:08,200
That would've been
my neighbor.

761
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:09,769
He uses it sometimes.

762
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,271
Lives up the hill there.

763
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:17,176
Well, thank you, sir.

764
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:18,411

768
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:52,631
Dr. Boone left for the day,
but if you'd like to follow me,

769
01:17:52,665 --> 01:17:55,334
the autopsy report
should be in his office.

770
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,869
Great.

771
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:58,838
This can't be the file.

772
01:17:58,871 --> 01:18:00,940
It has none
of the photo evidence in it.

773

Oh, I'll keep looking.

774
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:04,009

Who's this?

777
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:16,422
Dr. Boone's daughter,
Melissa.

778
01:18:16,455 --> 01:18:17,757
Melissa.

779
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,358
I didn't know
he had a daughter.

780

by a drunk driver

781
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:23,063
and left alone
in the forest to die.

782
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:24,764
Poor girl.

783
01:18:24,797 --> 01:18:26,665
Melissa.

784
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:28,868

Call the paramedics.

790
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,872
We got the APB out on Boone.

791
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,540
You okay?

792
01:19:43,676 --> 01:19:45,477

Why Gwen?

814
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:02,034
I was a good father.

815
01:24:02,068 --> 01:24:04,937
You were a drunk.

816
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,039
She would've grown
into a fuckup,

817
01:24:07,073 --> 01:24:08,674
just like you.

818
01:24:09,975 --> 01:24:11,710
A drain on everyone.

that no one would miss.

01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:44,810
Please.

823
01:24:49,082 --> 01:24:51,817
This man needs to die
for what he did to my daughter.

824
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,353
Rayburn, don't do this.

825
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:54,953
Don't do this.

826
01:24:54,987 --> 01:24:56,889
Let me take him in.

827
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:59,092
Let him rot in jail.

828
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:04,830
You want to talk to me
about right and wrong, Sheriff?

829
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,869
Now you can either walk away,
or you can shoot me again,

830
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:13,739

Goddamn it, Rayburn!

No.
