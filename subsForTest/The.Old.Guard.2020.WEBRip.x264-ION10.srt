1
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,750
<i>I've been here before...</i>

2
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,875
<i>over and over again,
and each time the same question.</i>

3
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,666
<i>Is this it?</i>

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,541
<i>Will this time be the one?</i>

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>And each time the same answer.</i>

6
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,291
<i>And I'm just so tired of it.</i>

7
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,375
You good?

8
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

9
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,333
You travel?

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,958
I did.

11
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,875
And I got you something.

12
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:22,958
What's that?

13
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,958
- Ooh, first edition <i>Don Quixote.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

14
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,166
- That couldn't have been cheap.
- It wasn't.

15
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,666
So why am I here, Booker?

16
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,250
You remember Surabaya
eight years ago, right?

17
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,250
CIA.

18
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,125
Yeah. The guy who hired us,
James Copley, reached out.

19
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,250
He's freelance now.

20
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,083
He has a hostage situation in South Sudan.

21
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,333
No, Booker. We don't do repeats.
You know that.

22
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,375
It's too risky.

23
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,291
Andy.

24
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,375
Joe and Nicky?

25
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,250
At the hotel.

26
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,791
Come back again.

27
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,458
Thank you. Welcome to El Fenn, sir.

28
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,041
Checking in?

29
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,791
- What brings you to Marrakesh?
- Family.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,666
Say, "Marrakesh!"

31
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,833
Marrakesh!

32
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,125
Would you like me to take one for you?

33
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,875
Oh, thank you so much.
I just really suck at taking selfies.

34
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,666
There you go.

35
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,250
Thank you!

36
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,666
Mmm!

37
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,333
- You look great.
- You look okay.

38
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you! Thank you!

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,375
And I have something for you.

40
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,541
Nicky!

41
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,291
Mmm!

42
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,250
Baklava.

43
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,666
Five hundred, Booker.

44
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,083
No.

45
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,791
All right.

46
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,250
- All in. Here it is.
- Really?

47
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,041
- All in!
- All in!

48
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,500
Mmm!

49
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,666
Hazelnut, not walnut.

50
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,333
The Black Sea.

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,083
Rosewater.

52
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,375
Pomegranate.

53
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,125
Mmm!

54
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,208
Eastern Turkey.

55
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,875
Ow!

56
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,708
No, no, no. Don't worry.

57
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,833
Admit it, boss. You missed us.

58
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,250
I did.

59
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,208
It's a job, guys.

60
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,958
We can do some good.

61
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,000
Have you been watching the news lately?

62
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,750
Some good means nothing.

63
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,875
I don't know about this, guys.

64
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,458
We're not helping.

65
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,333
I know you needed a break,
but it's been over a year, boss.

66
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,333
This is what we do, Andy.

67
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,708
I'll hear him out.

68
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,750
Mr. Copley.

69
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,916
Mr. Booker, <i>bonjour.</i>

70
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,875
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
- Last time I checked,

71
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,458
you had to be American to be in the CIA.

72
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,541
I was born in Boston.

73
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,625
Moved to London when I was three.

74
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,333
So why did you leave the agency,
Mr. Copley?

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,375
My wife got sick.

76
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,291
ALS.

77
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,458
She died two years ago.

78
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,458
Just haven't found my way back yet.

79
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,083
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

80
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,791
You haven't aged a day, Booker.

81
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,083
- Trust me, I have.
- Yeah.

82
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,375
Yesterday afternoon local,

83
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,375
a school southwest of Juba
was attacked by a militia.

84
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,375
They murdered the teachers and abducted
17 of the students at gunpoint.

85
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,916
The youngest was eight...

86
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,041
oldest, 13.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
<i>South Sudanese asked the US for help,</i>

88
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:25,000
<i>but current administration's policy
is to deny aid to any nonstrategic allies.</i>

89
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,916
Some of my ex-colleagues at the CIA
feel differently.

90
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,541
They reached out to me,
and I'm reaching out to you.

91
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,791
The last overfly confirmed
the personnel on site.

92
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,625
No food or water being brought in.

93
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,791
That means
they're moving them soon.

94
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,875
And when they do,

95
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,416
most likely they'll be separated,
and odds are we'll never find them again.

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
Has to be done quickly...

97
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,041
by the best,
and your team's the best I've ever seen.

98
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,666
You can name your price.

99
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,291
We'll invoice you when it's done.

100
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,583
Peace be with you.

101
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,083
What the...

102
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,208
Are we too late?

103
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,541
Motherfuck...

104
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,541
Room clear!

105
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
- Oh, my God!
- Shit!

106
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,166
Look out! Reload!

107
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,375
What the hell?

108
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,916
- Everyone still with me?
- Yeah.

109
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,333
Joe?

110
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,416
Very pissed off.

111
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,500
So where are the girls?

112
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,708
There never were any girls.

113
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,833
We've been set up.

114
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,791
Yeah, I got it.

115
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,208
Yeah.

116
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,416
One has to admire
Mr. Copley's attention to detail.

117
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,833
Those shoes were a particularly
grotesque touch.

118
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,375
I knew this was gonna happen.

119
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,166
I said it.

120
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,291
We did it right, Andy.

121
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,250
- For the right reasons.
- And what did it get us, Nicky? What?

122
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,291
Nothing.

123
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,500
We've done nothing.

124
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,166
The world isn't getting any better.

125
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,541
It's getting worse.

126
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,833
I checked him completely, and...

127
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,875
everything seemed legit.

128
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,291
I'm sorry, guys.

129
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,166
They know who we are.
They know what we are.

130
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,916
We have to find Copley.

131
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,500
We have to tie this thing off.

132
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,541
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

133
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,875
The world can burn for all I care.

134
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,083
I'm done.

135
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
Hmm?

136
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,125
Freeman, where you at?

137
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,500
Here, Sergeant.

138
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,708
The women are holed up in the house
with the arches.

139
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,208
Take a right at the building
with the red carpet.

140
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,375
- Get me some information.
- Roger that.

141
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,833
Keep it respectful.

142
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,750
Don't we always?

143
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,208
Never hurts to repeat it.

144
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,166
My name is Nile.

145
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,250
I am an American Marine.

146
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,500
We are looking for this man.

147
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,125
He has killed many of our people

148
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,208
and many of yours.

149
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,500
Have any of you seen him?

150
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
You do not disrespect your family

151
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,333
by telling us where he is.

152
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,958
There are no men here.

153
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,833
To use women as shields
is to be no man at all.

154
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,666
Thank you for allowing us into your home.

155
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,083
We will leave you in peace.

156
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,125
Breach!

157
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,125
Stop!

158
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,708
- Clear! Covering!
- Clear!

159
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,541
Lima 3, this is India 5. Contact, over.

160
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,291
Jay, go check on the women.

161
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,333
On it.

162
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,916
Look at all this shit.
It's jackpot.

163
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,333
Not if he bleeds out.
They wanted him alive, remember?

164
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,500
Do not...

165
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,625
Do not touch me.

166
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,625
I'm trying to save you, man.

167
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,208
Dizzy, a little help, please?

168
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,458
No! Medic!

169
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,625
Man down!

170
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,500
No! Jesus! Medic!

171
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,416
Stay with me!

172
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, my...

173
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,583
God! Jesus, no.

174
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,166
Come here. Stay with me. Look at me.

175
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,375
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

176
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,875
Nile! Nile!

177
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,666
You're okay. It's okay.
Stay with me. Just look at me. Look at me.

178
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,250
Okay. Medic's on their way.
Medic's on their way.

179
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,791
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

180
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,625
The medic's coming!

181
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,125
What the...

182
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:52,833
No.

183
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,291
No, not another one.

184
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,625
Not now.

185
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,750
It was a woman.

186
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,708
A black woman.

187
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,041
I saw an older woman in a hijab.

188
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,250
What did you see?

189
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,833
I saw...

190
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,291
I saw part of a name tag.

191
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,708
Uh, yeah. Free... free something.

192
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,166
- Yeah.
- Dirt floor, clay walls.

193
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,125
And a medevac.

194
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,500
Yeah, so maybe a, uh...
a coalition...

195
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,041
medical team.

196
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,291
The knife was a pesh-kabz. Pashtun.

197
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,000
I felt her die.

198
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,083
She's a Marine.

199
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,083
Combat.

200
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,416
Or near-combat duty.

201
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,000
Afghanistan.

202
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,208
It's been over 200 years.

203
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,958
Why now?

204
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,333
Everything happens for a reason, boss.

205
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,208
We have to find her.

206
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,666
No, we stick to the plan. We find Copley.

207
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,125
- So we just leave her out in the open?
- No, we're in the open.

208
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,291
- We're the ones who are exposed now.
- Not like her.

209
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,291
Nicky...

210
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,375
Not like her.

211
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,125
You can't tell me you don't remember
what it was like.

212
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:11,333
Whoever she is,
she's confused, and she's scared,

213
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,916
and she's more alone
than she has ever been in her entire life.

214
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,666
We all remember what it was like.

215
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,041
She needs us.

216
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,875
I'll handle the retrieval.

217
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,125
Hey, boss, come on.

218
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,708
If we're dreaming about her,
she's dreaming about us.

219
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,583
That makes her a beacon straight to us.

220
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,291
- What do we do in the meantime?
- Get to France.

221
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,750
Use the Charlie safe house.

222
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,458
I'll meet you there.

223
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,500
Find Copley.

224
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,666
Jesus.

225
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,708
She's just a baby.

226
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,333
I know I saw her die.

227
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,166
A little blood can look like a lot.

228
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,416
Adrenaline flying,
everyone was seeing shit they didn't.

229
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,666
I was holding her neck together
in my hands.

230
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,541
You'd rather we sent her home
in a body bag?

231
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,291
No, of course not.

232
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,291
So come on.

233
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,583
Hey, look who's up.

234
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,166
Nile?

235
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,583
What's up, Jay?

236
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,708
What's up, Dizzy?

237
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,333
So let's see the trophy.

238
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,208
Fuck me.

239
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,583
Nile, there's not even a scratch.

240
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,666
Yeah, they, uh...

241
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,791
They used this new skin graft
or something.

242
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,875
That what the doctor said?

243
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,208
Yeah.

244
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,416
That's what they said.

245
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:47,625
{\an8}<i>Our average lifespan is 78</i>
<i>in developed nations.</i>

246
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,875
Actually, two more years if you're
lucky enough to be born a female.

247
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,125
What can I say, ladies?

248
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,916
Now, all of this is because
of everyone's favorite love-to-hate...

249
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,375
Big Pharma.

250
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:03,000
At my company,
our research on telomere extension

251
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,458
has reversed the chromosomal clock
of human stem cells.

252
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,625
Dr. Kozak's manipulation
of the klotho hormone will, in time,

253
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:14,166
completely arrest
common cognitive decline.

254
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,250
Yes, we can all wave goodbye to dementia.

255
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,041
Now... wait!

256
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:21,041
Our work will add years of life

257
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,875
to the collective world population.

258
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,666
Years. Decades.

259
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,583
But it's not cheap.

260
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,291
We need investment.

261
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,833
Investment drives my enthusiasm
to take risks.

262
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:38,125
These risks improve countless lives.

263
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,000
My God.

264
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,875
You've seen my research.

265
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,666
Now you know they're for real.

266
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,333
What about the hard proof?

267
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,333
Blood, tissue, bone, DNA.

268
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,708
Recovering an uncontaminated sample
of the site proved impossible.

269
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,333
But you promised me hard proof.

270
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,916
There was an unanticipated
amount of carnage.

271
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,125
- But the footage...
- No, no.

272
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,833
The footage is
a two-million-dollar snuff film.

273
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,083
It doesn't give her the how.

274
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,458
I need all of them, Copley.

275
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,250
- I think I can get you one.
- No. No, not one. All.

276
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,083
These are extraordinary individuals.

277
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,708
They are extremely resistant to capture.

278
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,875
Well, consult with Keane, make a plan,
make it happen.

279
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:48,000
And quickly,
before my competitors get wind of this.

280
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,500
Corporal Freeman.

281
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,625
- Aye, Sergeant.
- Orders just came through.

282
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,583
They're sending you to Landstuhl, Germany
for more tests.

283
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:25,958
But I'm fine.

284
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,916
Plane's fueling. Pack your bags.

285
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,500
- Sergeant...
- We took these off you when it happened.

286
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,083
Didn't think you were coming back.

287
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:11,708
That's her.

288
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,000
Corporal Freeman.

289
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,208
Been looking for you.

290
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,291
Wheels up on your ride.

291
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,750
- Who are you?
- Andromache the Scythian.

292
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,000
But you can call me Andy.

293
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:54,375
Why does it have to be so goddamn slow
the first couple of times?

294
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,458
You shot me.

295
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,625
I did.
I need you to get back in the car, please.

296
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,416
This isn't real.
No, none of this is real.

297
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,333
You haven't figured this out yet?
You can't die.

298
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,333
Get up.

299
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:24,958
Argh! Fuck!

300
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,958
Can you please not do that again?

301
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,333
Who are you?

302
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,333
I lead a group of immortals.

303
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,416
An army, I guess.

304
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,833
Soldiers. Fighters like you.

305
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:49,750
Look...

306
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,375
You've got questions, kid.

307
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,291
I get it.

308
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,916
You want answers?

309
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,041
Get back in the car.

310
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,541
Put those on.

311
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,041
- Where are you taking me?
- Paris.

312
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,125
- You've got blood in your hair.
- Wonder why?

313
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,625
This guy's a drug runner.

314
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,375
This the shit you into?

315
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,750
Well, sometimes you gotta work with people
you don't wanna eat with.

316
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,875
Is this even safe?

317
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,416
Does it really matter?

318
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,500
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

319
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,750
You found Copley?

320
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,625
Nothing but dead ends.

321
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,500
<i>He knows we're hunting him.</i>

322
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,416
Keep looking.

323
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,458
<i>He's doing the same to us.</i>

324
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,166
I have the new one.

325
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,416
And?

326
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,041
Well, she stabbed me,
so I think she has potential.

327
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,583
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

328
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,250
So why is this happening to me?

329
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,541
I wish I knew.

330
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,291
You said you had answers.

331
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,250
I didn't say you'd like them.

332
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,541
Are you praying?

333
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,291
God doesn't exist.

334
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:35,166
My God does.

335
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:39,166
You know, there was a time
when I was worshiped as a god.

336
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:47,958
Was that Him?

337
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,291
Don't worry, I can't do shit like that.

338
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,541
None of it means anything anyway.

339
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,625
You said there were others.

340
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,250
How many?

341
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,666
Four.

342
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,416
You're an army of four?

343
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,958
So that's why you took me?

344
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,583
So I could join your army?

345
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,750
Yeah.

346
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:14,208
No. This is some bullshit.

347
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,625
You must...

348
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,750
Must have hypnotized me, or...

349
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,958
or, uh, drugged me or something.

350
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:26,166
And that was a blank
that you shot me with.

351
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,166
And I was the one who cut your throat.

352
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,250
Right?

353
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:37,666
Listen, kid.

354
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,791
You already believe in...

355
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,708
You should just keep following
that illogic.

356
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,208
You're already on board
with the supernatural.

357
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,500
If I were you, I'd get some sleep.

358
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,833
We're not going to Paris.

359
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,000
Andrei.

360
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:18,750
Come here.

361
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,000
Sit your ass down!

362
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,833
- Stand up!
- You do not listen to her.

363
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:24,791
You listen to me.

364
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,666
Land this plane.

365
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,125
Trust me. She's not gonna shoot you.

366
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,375
I am.

367
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,750
Who's gonna fly the plane?

368
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,583
We don't need a pilot.

369
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,250
We can jump and survive.

370
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,750
I am not jumping from a plane!

371
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,833
Whoa! Shit! Maybe we do need a pilot.

372
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,208
I can fly a plane.

373
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,833
You don't speak Russian, do you?

374
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,125
Why?

375
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,625
Because I told the pilot to play dead.

376
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,666
You really want to do this, kid?

377
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,666
We're done.

378
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,083
I said we're done.

379
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,625
You're very good.

380
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:17,541
What's your name?

381
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:20,750
Nile.

382
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,875
You see? You're already healing faster.

383
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,375
Is this real?

384
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,250
I got people that love me.

385
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,750
People that are gonna worry.

386
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,250
I'm a Marine.

387
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,083
- They think I went AWOL.
- You're not a Marine anymore.

388
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,833
They're going to lock you up.

389
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,291
I thought you said
we were going to Paris.

390
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,541
We're just outside of Paris.

391
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,791
This is Goussainville.

392
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,666
This place has been abandoned
for 50 years.

393
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,166
Why?

394
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,583
So are you good guys or bad guys?

395
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,625
Depends on the century.

396
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,333
We fight for what we think is right.

397
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,458
How are you all in my dreams?

398
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:35,166
We dream of each other.
They stop when we meet.

399
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,250
Why?

400
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:40,666
I believe it's because we...
we're meant to find each other.

401
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:44,583
It's like destiny.

402
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,333
No, more like misery loves company.

403
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,375
What he said.

404
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,916
It used to take years to track a new one.

405
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,208
Booker was the last.

406
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:58,916
1812.

407
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:02,375
No way.

408
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:06,041
Yeah, I died fighting with Napoleon.

409
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:10,041
So... you're even older than him.

410
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,500
Mmm... Nicky and I met in the Crusades.

411
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,791
The Crusades?

412
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,125
The love of my life was of the people
I've been taught to hate.

413
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,250
We...

414
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,541
We killed each other.

415
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,625
- Many times.
- Yeah.

416
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,375
You're the oldest.

417
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,250
Yeah.

418
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:34,958
So how old are you?

419
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,500
- Old.
- How old?

420
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,583
Too old.

421
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,166
So we really never die.

422
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,791
Nothing that lives lives forever.

423
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,666
But... you said that we were immortal.

424
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,833
I know what I said.

425
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,791
And we mostly are, but we can die.

426
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,375
And one of us did.

427
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:04,791
He...

428
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:07,541
<i>He was a warrior, just like us.</i>

429
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,416
<i>A long time ago.</i>

430
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,500
One day your wounds
just don't heal up anymore, and...

431
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,250
we don't know when or why.

432
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,333
So if we can die,

433
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,708
then why would you shoot me?

434
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,958
You could have killed me.

435
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,458
You're too new.

436
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,583
It is a lot to understand.

437
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,500
I think you should get some rest.

438
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:41,666
Come with me.

439
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,583
I'll show you.

440
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:53,291
She wants to talk to her family.

441
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,666
That's not gonna help her.

442
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:00,583
You tell her that.

443
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,666
What's going on?

444
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,541
What happened?

445
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,958
It's just a... a bad dream.

446
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,166
I'm sorry.

447
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:55,541
Tell us.

448
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,833
I saw flashes of it before...

449
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,000
when I first dreamt of all of you.

450
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,208
But now it's clearer.

451
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,041
I dreamed about
a woman locked in an iron coffin...

452
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,208
under the sea.

453
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:17,125
She kept...

454
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:20,750
drowning and then coming back to life.

455
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:26,333
She was hammering her bloody fists
and knees against the iron.

456
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:30,375
She felt like something insane,
something furious.

457
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:33,041
But she kept fighting...

458
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,541
and she kept drowning.

459
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,250
Her name was Quynh.

460
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,458
<i>She was one of us.</i>

461
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,416
<i>The first immortal Andy found.</i>

462
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:02,791
<i>They had been alone so long,
when she found her...</i>

463
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,625
<i>Quynh had given up.</i>

464
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,250
Way back, it was her and Andy.

465
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,958
Before me and Nicky,
it was just the two of them.

466
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:19,000
<i>They ran through the world together.
Fought thousands of battles side by side.</i>

467
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,791
<i>She was a pit viper in a fight.</i>

468
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,041
They were in England,

469
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:38,833
freeing so-called heretics
from the witch trials.

470
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,458
But then, Andy and Quynh,

471
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:44,250
they were accused of witchcraft
themselves,

472
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,583
<i>- and they were trapped and caught.</i>
- Killers!

473
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,666
Some will rot in hell!

474
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,583
<i>When they didn't die,</i>
<i>it proved their case,</i>

475
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:55,583
<i>and they got sentenced again and again.</i>

476
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:02,750
I've never been burned alive before.

477
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,208
What do you think it's gonna be like?

478
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,125
Excruciating.

479
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,125
Just you and me.

480
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:19,916
Until the end.

481
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,500
No! No!

482
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:37,458
No, not this.

483
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,750
- No!
- Where are you taking her?

484
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,375
You are too powerful together.

485
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,916
For creatures such as you,
there is no salvation.

486
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,416
Please! No!

487
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,541
Quynh!

488
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,500
Quynh!

489
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,125
Andromache!

490
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,250
Andromache!

491
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:12,041
No!

492
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:31,458
After Andy escaped,
we spent decades searching for her

493
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,958
or anyone on that ship
who could tell us where she was cast off.

494
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,833
She's lived
with that guilt ever since,

495
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:40,708
but she blames herself for Quynh's fate.

496
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,583
Why do you blame yourself?

497
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,833
I lost a soldier.

498
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,541
I feel her pain.

499
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,750
Her rage.

500
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:58,416
She feels crazy.

501
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,833
Over 500 years in a box...

502
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,666
<i>at the bottom of the ocean...</i>

503
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,791
<i>would make anyone insane.</i>

504
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:12,208
<i>That's the reason</i>
<i>why we dread capture.</i>

505
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:15,041
<i>Spend eternity in a cage.</i>

506
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,291
Nile.

507
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,791
I don't want this.

508
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:02,416
I don't want any of it.

509
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,750
I know. I know.

510
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,333
There isn't one good thing in any of this.

511
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,041
I know this is hard.

512
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,333
It's happening
whether you want it or not.

513
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,500
I know you're scared, Nile.

514
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:28,000
Me and those three men in there
will keep you safe.

515
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,041
Like Quynh?

516
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,583
We're all you've got.

517
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:47,791
What's happening?

518
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,125
They found us.

519
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,125
Joe? Nicky?

520
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,208
Shit.

521
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:10,875
Booker.

522
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:14,916
You still with me?

523
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,833
Clear the back room. Find Joe and Nicky.

524
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Hey.

525
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:22,416
Hey.

526
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,000
Book.

527
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,458
Come on.

528
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,416
Come back to me.

529
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,916
You're still in this shitty game with me.

530
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,333
You hear me?

531
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,291
Now wake up.

532
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,458
Wake up!

533
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,583
They're not here.

534
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,041
Welcome back, asshole.

535
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,625
Thanks for taking your time.

536
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,333
It hurts everywhere.

537
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,166
How bad is it?

538
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:08,916
It's an improvement.

539
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,500
How many?

540
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,333
I don't know.

541
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,541
- Where are Nicky and Joe?
- I don't know!

542
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,666
I... I turned on the game.

543
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:23,916
<i>A grenade hit me.</i>

544
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,333
Lost the plot after that.

545
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,500
- <i>Two in transport.</i>
- No, no. We need the woman.

546
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,541
<i>Wasn't there,
and the other guy's in pieces.</i>

547
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,833
She's there.

548
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,791
- Copley.
- Copley?

549
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,958
They're coming back.
They want all of us.

550
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,208
You stay here.

551
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:44,000
Wait for my signal.

552
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:45,458
What signal?

553
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:49,666
- What does that even mean?
- You'll know it when it comes.

554
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,333
And, by the way,
it's not always like this now.

555
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,916
Big wounds take longer to heal.

556
00:55:58,541 --> 00:55:59,500
Sure.

557
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,375
<i>Bravo Team approaching church.</i>

558
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,125
Go, go, go.

559
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,541
Come on! Move! Move!

560
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,916
We've gotta get out there!

561
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,041
We need to help her.

562
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,583
No, that's not the signal.

563
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:29,958
Mr. Keane,

564
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,625
I strongly recommend
that we leave right now.

565
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:45,416
Come on!

566
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:47,625
Let's move!

567
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,083
Wait for the signal.

568
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,041
How the hell can you even tell?

569
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:55,916
- Oh.
- Let's go!

570
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,250
Andy did all this herself?

571
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,916
Yeah. That woman has forgotten
more ways to kill

572
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,500
than entire armies will ever learn.

573
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,041
Who are they? How'd they find you?

574
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,416
I don't know. Let's go!

575
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,291
Nicolo.

576
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,875
- Quiet.
- Nicolo, wake up.

577
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,666
- I said...
- I know what you said.

578
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,208
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

579
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:02,666
Wake up.

580
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,583
Wake up!

581
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:04,666
I'm here.

582
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,416
I'm here.

583
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,791
Wherever here is.

584
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:10,958
In an armored van.

585
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,875
They used gas.

586
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,708
I told you, shut up!

587
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,083
I need to know he's okay.

588
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,458
That's sweet.

589
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:19,708
What is he? Your boyfriend?

590
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,208
You're a child.

591
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,041
An infant.

592
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,458
Your mocking is thus infantile.

593
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,083
He's not my boyfriend.

594
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:33,375
This man is more to me than you can dream.

595
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:37,958
He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness
and warmth when I shiver in cold.

596
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,500
And his kiss still thrills me,
even after a millennia.

597
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,708
His heart overflows with the kindness
of which this world is not worthy of.

598
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,416
I love this man beyond measure and reason.
He's not my boyfriend.

599
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,416
He's all and he's more.

600
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,541
You're an incurable romantic.

601
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:25,291
I don't suppose it would be possible
to get these chains off of us?

602
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,833
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!
Get 'em on the plane now!

603
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,000
I guess not.

604
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,291
We are usually
a better judge of character.

605
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:38,875
I suppose you are taking us
to the person who paid for your betrayal.

606
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:41,666
It's a nice plane.

607
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,500
There's a TV, Joe.

608
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:46,083
Champagne?

609
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:05,625
What is this place?

610
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:07,625
An abandoned mine.

611
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,375
We stumbled on it
during the Baussenque Wars.

612
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,291
1150s maybe?

613
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,250
I used to keep my stuff here.

614
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Here...

615
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,625
Is this a Rodin?

616
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:02,750
Yeah.

617
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,958
This is an honest-to-God Rodin.

618
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:07,958
Wait.

619
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:09,916
Did you know him?

620
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,500
Probably biblically.

621
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,416
Get to work finding Copley.

622
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,541
He's got Nicky and Joe.

623
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,708
It can hardly be unique
if they can make another copy.

624
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,666
I've got to go.

625
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,833
Ah! Gentlemen, welcome.

626
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,833
I am truly honored to meet you.

627
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,000
Together, we shall do such things.

628
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,416
What they are yet, I know not,

629
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,708
but they shall be
the terrors of the Earth.

630
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,541
Or, um, rather the saviors.

631
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,333
Lear...

632
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,291
Shakespeare.

633
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,500
Um, can we take the cuffs off?

634
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,291
No, sir. We can't.

635
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,333
My apologies.
Let's get off on the right foot, shall we?

636
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:08,250
I'm Steven Merrick,
youngest CEO in pharma.

637
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,875
Our work here is all about balance.

638
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:15,500
How do we push the scientific frontiers
whilst also turning a little profit?

639
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:18,583
There's your balance, asshole.

640
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,625
- Mr. Merrick?
- Yes, yes, yes.

641
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:23,583
Watch it.

642
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:28,250
Mr. Copley provided me
with footage of your unique talent,

643
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:32,250
but I prefer my evidence
to be indisputable.

644
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,250
No!

645
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,125
Mr. Merrick!

646
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,583
God damn it! Ugh!

647
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,875
Shit!

648
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,541
What do you see?

649
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:48,375
The Nobel Prize.

650
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,458
And a fair few quid to boot.

651
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:57,541
We brought a cancer drug
to the market last quarter.

652
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:01,208
It's already saved
hundreds of thousands of lives.

653
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:04,625
Yet, in development,
it killed a quarter of a million lab mice.

654
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,458
Now, I didn't ask
for their little permissions.

655
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:09,958
I'm not gonna ask for yours.

656
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,208
He thinks you're a mouse, Nicky.

657
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:15,125
There's genetic code inside you

658
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,375
which could help
every human being on Earth.

659
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,833
We're morally obliged to take it.

660
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,958
What?

661
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,958
- What is that? Wait!
- Hey!

662
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:29,500
No!

663
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,958
I'll keep you informed of my progress.

664
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,000
Yes. Yes, you do that.

665
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,708
Mr. Merrick...

666
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,958
this is about science,

667
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,666
not profits...

668
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,666
or sadism.

669
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,500
You owe me two more.

670
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,791
Come on, Book.
You've been working on that for hours.

671
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,291
He's a security expert.

672
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,750
He leaves no footprints.
It's gonna take time.

673
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,083
You got a satellite link?

674
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah.

675
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,583
Follow the money.

676
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,291
Whoever he's working for, maybe?

677
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,500
That's how we track militants.

678
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,625
I'm sure you already tried that.

679
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,583
Yeah, it won't hurt to try again.

680
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,083
You know how it works, Nile.

681
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:41,833
Get some sleep while you can.

682
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,666
I brought you a change of clothes.

683
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,625
I'm going out for a bit.

684
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,125
- Are you all right, boss?
- Yeah.

685
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,541
Just because we keep living
doesn't mean we stop hurting.

686
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:28,791
Why us?

687
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:30,583
Yeah.

688
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,333
That way madness lies.

689
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:38,041
I thought you were
the brains of this outfit.

690
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,041
Tell you what I do wonder...

691
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,583
is why you?

692
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,166
And why now?

693
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,416
How old is Andy?

694
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,750
Well, she says she...
she doesn't remember.

695
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:03,250
And she may not. I don't know.

696
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,416
But what I do know
is she was alone for a long time

697
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,916
before she found anyone like her.

698
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:10,500
A very long time.

699
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,125
What about you? You have someone?

700
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,000
Just my family.

701
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,916
I had three sons.

702
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,208
And the youngest one, Jean-Pierre...

703
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,708
was the last one to die.

704
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:35,250
He was 42 when...

705
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:38,333
cancer took him.

706
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,208
The only way is forward now.

707
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,250
What do you mean?

708
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:46,916
You'll always and forever
be the young woman right there...

709
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,625
but everyone around you,

710
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,000
everyone you love...

711
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:54,458
is gonna grow old,

712
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,375
is gonna...

713
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:59,333
is gonna suffer and is gonna die.

714
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,000
And if you try to...

715
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:10,958
if you try to touch their lives...

716
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,041
well, they will get to learn your secret.

717
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,625
<i>They will beg you to share it with them,
and you won't be able to.</i>

718
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:21,625
And they won't believe you, of course.

719
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,833
And they will tell you...

720
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,041
that you don't love them.

721
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,416
<i>That your love is weak...</i>

722
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,166
or selfish.

723
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,416
And you will never forget...

724
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:42,625
the hate...

725
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,875
and despair in their eyes.

726
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,125
And you will know what it is to lose...

727
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,083
everyone you've ever loved.

728
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,750
Do you have a bathroom?

729
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:03,916
No.

730
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,208
But we have a storeroom.

731
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:13,833
Do you need help?

732
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,583
Stitches would be better, but...

733
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:39,875
this will help.

734
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:42,041
You haven't asked.

735
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:44,375
Your business is yours.

736
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,083
You need help.

737
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,416
What does it matter why?

738
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,791
Today, I put this on your wound.

739
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:56,750
Tomorrow...

740
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,875
you help someone up when they fall.

741
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:05,333
We're not meant to be alone.

742
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,125
There.

743
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,458
This should do.

744
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,083
Thank you.

745
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:00,833
<i>Andromache, help me!</i>

746
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:02,916
Why won't it stop?

747
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:05,500
This can't be happening.

748
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,416
Lykon.

749
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:09,458
It's time.

750
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,583
It's impossible.

751
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:14,541
It...

752
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:15,708
It's time.

753
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,041
How long will the testing take?

754
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,500
Until we have results we can replicate.

755
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,833
Do you feel the wound trying to close?

756
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,333
You don't need them for that.

757
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,333
You've got the samples,
blood, tissue, DNA.

758
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:54,458
Well, you know
the concept of proprietary data,

759
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,291
and they're the product.

760
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:01,083
They go in the vault.
They stay there under lock and key.

761
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,333
For... ever?

762
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:07,125
We can't have them strolling back out
into the world...

763
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:09,791
into my competitors' laps.

764
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,291
If this takes years, maybe decades,

765
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,041
what does it matter to them?

766
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:20,041
If we can unlock their genetic code,
the world will be begging us for the key.

767
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,500
Remarkable.

768
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,125
You will not be able
to give him what he wants.

769
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:30,000
You think I go too far?

770
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:32,458
That I am unethical?

771
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,291
I would say immoral.

772
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,250
I believe this can change the world.

773
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,375
A fine justification.

774
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,291
I've heard it so many times before.

775
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:02,000
As much as I like watching you sleep,
I'm glad you're awake.

776
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,125
Bed head?

777
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,375
Nicely tousled.

778
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:18,041
Do you know, I was thinking about Malta.

779
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:20,833
What time in Malta?

780
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,500
Oh, that time in Malta.

781
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,958
We should go back there.

782
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,208
That would be nice.

783
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,291
Your mom and brother?

784
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,000
You have my phone?

785
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,916
Where's your father?

786
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,333
Killed in action when I was 11.

787
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:33,666
Here...

788
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:42,708
My mom, she was drowning after he died.

789
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,916
South Side of Chicago,

790
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,416
a million different ways
we could have went left.

791
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,375
She fought for us.

792
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,583
Never backed down.

793
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,416
Never let us back down either.

794
01:16:58,416 --> 01:16:59,750
You come from warriors.

795
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:01,833
Yeah.

796
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,916
I do.

797
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,583
I can't remember
what my mother looked like.

798
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,041
Or my sisters.

799
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:18,666
None of them.

800
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,166
Time steals it all away, I guess.

801
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:25,791
It's not what time steals...

802
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,208
it's what it leaves behind.

803
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:34,041
Things you can't forget.

804
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,541
I gave up searching for her.

805
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,666
I made Quynh a promise and I broke it.

806
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,416
I'm getting Joe and Nicky back.

807
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,208
Whatever it takes.

808
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,708
"Whatever it takes"?

809
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:10,916
Yes.

810
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:13,000
Guys, I found something.

811
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:15,166
An address just outside of London.

812
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:22,791
We gotta go.

813
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,375
Go scout the back.

814
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,833
I can't do this.

815
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,250
Yes, you can.

816
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:18,000
I mean, I'm not doing this.

817
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:23,375
You're one of us now.

818
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:25,583
We would do the same for you.

819
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:28,208
- I never even had a choice.
- None of us had a choice.

820
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:30,083
There isn't a choice.

821
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,166
The day I died,

822
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:36,083
I killed the guy that killed me.

823
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,208
They try to condition us, you know?

824
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,708
Thousands of hours of training.

825
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,291
Two shots, quick kill.

826
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,791
But they can't teach you how
to live with it.

827
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,833
You've gotta feel it, Nile.

828
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,000
Every one.

829
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:55,333
I saw what you did in that church.

830
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,833
All those bodies.

831
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:01,458
Is that supposed to be me?

832
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,083
Is that what we're supposed to do,
and we don't even know why?

833
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:08,291
You think knowing
is gonna make you sleep better at night?

834
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:10,541
I can't be that.

835
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:14,875
My family,

836
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,375
they're gonna get old and I won't,

837
01:20:18,791 --> 01:20:21,458
but it'll be years
before they realize that.

838
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,833
I still have time with them.

839
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:30,875
Here.

840
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,416
Take the car,

841
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,333
and when you ditch it, ditch the weapons.

842
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,500
You gonna be okay?

843
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:43,791
Always.

844
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,083
Where's Nile?

845
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:01,541
You and me, Book. Now and always.

846
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:11,041
<i>Guildford station</i>
<i>in one mile.</i>

847
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:41,916
Empty?

848
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,166
Shit.

849
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:52,958
Andy.

850
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:27,250
Where are they?

851
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,416
Andromache the Scythian.

852
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,541
The eternal warrior.

853
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:38,666
- Book?
- I'm right here.

854
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:48,541
Where are Joe and Nicky?

855
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,750
What are you doing?

856
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:56,791
Calm down.

857
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,541
- What are you doing?
- Andy, calm down!

858
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,833
No!

859
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,458
Shh.

860
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,375
You set us up?

861
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:10,625
Please listen.

862
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,125
When my wife died,

863
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,458
I devoted myself to your work.

864
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:19,166
I learned your secret history,

865
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,541
written in the margins...

866
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:23,375
passed on like legend.

867
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:28,208
What was dismissed as a myth was,
in fact, immortality.

868
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:32,125
You could help end... needless suffering.

869
01:23:42,541 --> 01:23:44,833
Humanity needs you to share your gifts.

870
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:49,541
Humanity can screw itself.

871
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,916
- Andy...
- Don't, you fucking coward.

872
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:01,583
Why?

873
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,083
Why, Book?

874
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:06,291
- Andy, listen...
- Why?

875
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,000
If Merrick can discover
how we keep living,

876
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,416
he might find a way how to end it.

877
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,166
Hey.

878
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:21,375
That's what you wanted.

879
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,500
Oh, Book. What have you done?

880
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:30,333
Not like this, Book.

881
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:35,833
What's going on?

882
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:37,500
You're still bleeding.

883
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,208
You're still bleeding.

884
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:42,375
What? Shit.

885
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,416
She's not healing.

886
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,625
- What?
- Look at this. She's not healing.

887
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,291
Go get something. Go on! Go on!

888
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,083
Andy, look at me.

889
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:53,750
Look at me.

890
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,166
Why didn't you tell me?

891
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,083
It wouldn't have changed anything.

892
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,541
Hurry up!

893
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:06,541
Come on.

894
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,500
Careful.

895
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:10,083
Get her out of here.

896
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,000
Secure him.

897
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,500
Nice work, Copley.

898
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:18,666
Look at you.

899
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,041
She's wounded. Gunshot.

900
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,333
Why isn't she healing?

901
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:24,041
I don't know.

902
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:26,791
She's not immortal.

903
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,625
- What do you mean, "not immortal?"
- I mean it's gone.

904
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,541
You're a bloody mess.

905
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:47,208
Now, how old are you?

906
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:52,208
Come closer and I'll tell you.

907
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:57,083
Let's get them home.

908
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:00,000
- Let her go.
- Cover me.

909
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:02,333
- No! No!
- Let her go!

910
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,000
Get her up.

911
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,500
No!

912
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,083
I'm sorry, Andy.

913
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,000
I'm sorry.

914
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,625
Hold him still.

915
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,625
Mr. Merrick, look. If it's true and
she's somehow not immortal anymore,

916
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,583
then she might not survive the testing.

917
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:30,333
- This will be murder.
- As if the CIA never disappeared anyone.

918
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:32,708
As if they never conducted
covert research.

919
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:33,625
No.

920
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:36,083
No, this is not what we agreed.

921
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:38,541
We don't stop.

922
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,000
Andy.

923
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,291
What happened?

924
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:55,583
She's not healing.

925
01:26:57,958 --> 01:26:58,875
I killed her.

926
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,833
I need to get a line in her
and stop the bleeding.

927
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:11,125
Keep her alive at all costs.

928
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:15,166
Don't you see? Between Sudan and now,
something's changed.

929
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:18,083
- Find out what.
- This will stabilize her,

930
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,791
but I have to stitch her

931
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,000
- and give her antibiotics.
- Good.

932
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,833
All things die.

933
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:26,750
What was that?

934
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:29,125
Everything has to die, Mr. Merrick.

935
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:33,291
The only reason we haven't...

936
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,750
is that it's not our time yet.

937
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:40,125
If it's now Andromache's,
nothing you can do will stop it.

938
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,833
You'd be surprised by
what my products can do.

939
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:48,750
I will carve slices off you for years
to get what I want.

940
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:51,875
Your time is coming.

941
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:53,375
As is yours.

942
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,208
I expect results!

943
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:04,958
Andy.

944
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,875
Uh-uh.

945
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,916
Are you Copley?

946
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,166
- He sent you to finish me off.
- Who?

947
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,583
Where's Andy and Booker?

948
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:25,916
Who are you?

949
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:28,791
Ahh!

950
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:31,083
Son of a bitch!

951
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,458
You're another one.

952
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,416
Yeah. I'm new.

953
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:39,458
- Where are they?
- They're in a lab...

954
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:40,708
being tested.

955
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:43,791
Tortured.

956
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:45,625
Merrick...

957
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,916
he only cares about her immortality,

958
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,041
not what she's done with it.

959
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:52,791
"What she's done with it"?

960
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:55,833
Montenegro, 1916.

961
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:58,541
She saved a family of refugees
whose daughter would discover

962
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,791
the technique
for the early detection of diabetes.

963
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:03,125
This one...

964
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:07,625
Her grandson would save 317 people
from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

965
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:09,250
This guy...

966
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:12,958
This man prevented
an accidental nuclear exchange in 1978

967
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:15,458
and likely saved civilization as a result.

968
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,500
The famous...

969
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,666
and the unknown names.

970
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,875
She saves a life,

971
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,916
two, three generations later,
we reap the benefits.

972
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,000
She's in it.

973
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,041
She can't see it.

974
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,708
But you could.

975
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,750
You could and you gave them up.

976
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,375
I thought it could be the end of disease.

977
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,291
I thought it could be
the end of suffering.

978
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,666
She couldn't talk...

979
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:04,250
at the end...

980
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:05,750
my wife.

981
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:09,916
She couldn't breathe.

982
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,666
I couldn't do...

983
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,208
anything.

984
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:18,708
It was supposed to be a gift...

985
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:21,375
to the world.

986
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,666
It wasn't your gift to give.

987
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,458
Why would the immortality end?

988
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,041
What?

989
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,416
She wouldn't stop bleeding.

990
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:40,208
Is she alive?

991
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:42,916
I know where they are.

992
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,250
There's no cameras here.

993
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,000
That's how he gets people
in and out unseen.

994
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,333
- How many shooters on site?
- At least 30.

995
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,416
Their boss, Keane, is ex-Special Forces.

996
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,250
What kind of CEO rolls around
with his own personal army?

997
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:34,583
These days?

998
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:35,916
Most of them.

999
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:38,583
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make this right.

1000
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:40,250
Your dying won't do that.

1001
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,208
But I'm supposed to let you
walk in there by yourself?

1002
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:44,416
Out of the two of us,

1003
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,333
I'm the one
who will walk out of there again,

1004
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:47,583
one way or another.

1005
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:53,625
You got me here.

1006
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:01,416
There's a private lab on the 15th floor.

1007
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,583
It's empty.

1008
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:06,250
This will get you access.

1009
01:32:11,416 --> 01:32:14,750
You should get out of here
before the noise starts.

1010
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:23,166
Good luck, Ms. Freeman.

1011
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:05,083
Floor's closed. How'd you get up here?

1012
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:06,791
Sorry, I was just looking...

1013
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:08,500
Hands! Let me see your hands.

1014
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,583
Zero, this is Alpha 2-2.

1015
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,041
Sir.

1016
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,375
Zero. Send.

1017
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:23,958
<i>We've had an intruder.</i>
<i>Target is down.</i>

1018
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:27,958
See if you can get an ID off the body.

1019
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,125
Shit!

1020
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:39,791
TAC teams, find Merrick now!

1021
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:49,750
- You selfish piece of shit!
- Joe, leave it. Please!

1022
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,041
What do you know
of the weight of all these years alone?

1023
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:55,541
- You're a very pathetic man, Booker.
- Joe, Stop.

1024
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:57,375
You and Nicky
always had each other, right?

1025
01:33:58,083 --> 01:33:59,416
And all we had...

1026
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:00,958
was our grief.

1027
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:03,208
Well, now you have even more.

1028
01:34:11,583 --> 01:34:13,333
- Who the hell are you?
- Where's the lab?

1029
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,208
Shit!

1030
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:28,791
There's another one!

1031
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,833
She's going for the rest of them.
Doctor's lab, now!

1032
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,625
I'm locking you down in the penthouse
until this is over.

1033
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:52,416
Nile.

1034
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:55,083
Behind you!

1035
01:34:58,833 --> 01:34:59,833
Nile!

1036
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:06,083
There's four shooters at the door
and more coming.

1037
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,166
Andy.

1038
01:35:20,958 --> 01:35:22,333
Immortal or not,

1039
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,416
you made a promise.

1040
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:26,791
Whatever it takes.

1041
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:30,208
I've seen it, Andy.

1042
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,166
I know all the good you've done.

1043
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:45,708
You came back.

1044
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:49,708
Yeah.

1045
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,791
No, just leave me here.

1046
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,833
No man left behind.

1047
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,416
There's always a first time.
He's nothing but a traitor. That's...

1048
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,750
Stop! This is not the time for it.

1049
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:04,541
We don't get a say in when it ends.
We never have.

1050
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:06,916
But we can control how we live.

1051
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:09,666
And to be honest, Book,

1052
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:11,916
you and I,

1053
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,291
we've been doing a shit job of it.

1054
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:15,583
Now, get up.

1055
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:16,750
Let's go.

1056
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:20,458
We stop Merrick here and now
or he never stops coming after us.

1057
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:29,791
Andy.

1058
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,000
Are you sure?

1059
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:33,666
This changes nothing.

1060
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:36,125
We walk out of here like always.

1061
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,833
Together.

1062
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,583
Let's get this motherfucker.

1063
01:36:58,541 --> 01:36:59,541
Cover Andy.

1064
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:28,875
Andy! Ahh!

1065
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:33,250
Man! Andy!

1066
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:43,375
Joe, Nicky, we're moving out!

1067
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:46,291
Assault team, move! You two, flank.

1068
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:46,416
<i>What's your location?</i>

1069
01:39:47,916 --> 01:39:49,291
Enough of this shit.

1070
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:04,500
Let's go. Andy.

1071
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:08,916
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1072
01:40:13,791 --> 01:40:15,041
Shit! Jammed!

1073
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:21,375
Where's Andy?

1074
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:25,583
<i>Hold at the bridge.</i>

1075
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,041
- Roger that.
- Fuck.

1076
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:09,666
Where's Merrick?

1077
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:17,375
Penthouse.

1078
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:23,375
What do you think? Oslo, '67?

1079
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:25,958
São Paulo, '34. Nile's with me.

1080
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:28,041
What happened in São Paulo in 1934?

1081
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:29,375
1834.

1082
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:31,000
You'll see.

1083
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,125
First team, hold the hall.

1084
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:51,750
First team.

1085
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:01,750
Wait for the signal.

1086
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:04,125
This gonna be like the last signal?

1087
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:07,166
Go big or go home.

1088
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:10,750
Keane.

1089
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:15,041
Keane, how many more do we have coming?

1090
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:17,250
This is it. Dig in.

1091
01:42:26,666 --> 01:42:27,666
I'll make the entry.

1092
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:29,666
Stay tight to me, okay?

1093
01:42:30,291 --> 01:42:31,291
I'll protect you.

1094
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,458
I go through first.

1095
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:36,916
I always go first.

1096
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,041
Andy, put on the damn armor.

1097
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:42,041
It's like Nicky said,
"If it's my time, it's my time."

1098
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:45,125
If this doesn't work out,

1099
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:48,958
next time, you go first.

1100
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:01,708
What the hell are they waiting for?

1101
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:04,583
Shit!

1102
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:37,666
You shot Nicky.

1103
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:39,833
You shouldn't have done that.

1104
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:56,958
The elevator is going down!

1105
01:43:57,416 --> 01:43:59,208
- Merrick is getting away!
- Go!

1106
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,041
I'll stay with Andy.

1107
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:16,500
You okay?

1108
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

1109
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
It just hurts.

1110
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:26,583
Actually, everything hurts.

1111
01:44:28,291 --> 01:44:30,166
Well, wait until tomorrow.

1112
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:37,000
Can't wait.

1113
01:44:46,833 --> 01:44:49,541
I think you showed up
when I lost my immortality.

1114
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,083
So I could see what it was like.

1115
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:54,750
So I could remember.

1116
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:56,750
Remember?

1117
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:58,958
Remember what it...

1118
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:04,208
what it was like to feel unbreakable.

1119
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:06,208
Remarkable.

1120
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,833
You reminded me there are people...

1121
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:16,750
still worth fighting for.

1122
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:30,083
I know how I want to spend the time
I've got left.

1123
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:33,833
You're gonna spend it with us, Andy.

1124
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:37,833
You selfish little bitch!

1125
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:39,333
I will kill her!

1126
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,666
All the lives you could save.

1127
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:52,583
Don't you see what we could do here?

1128
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:54,125
You are priceless.

1129
01:45:55,958 --> 01:45:56,791
Hey, Nile.

1130
01:45:59,291 --> 01:46:00,833
Do you think he speaks Russian?

1131
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:23,541
Play dead, motherfucker.

1132
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:33,583
Nile?

1133
01:46:38,916 --> 01:46:39,750
Hey.

1134
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:45,291
She's okay.

1135
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:53,250
Come on.

1136
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,291
Faster than the elevator.

1137
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:01,291
It's okay, Nile.

1138
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,750
- Ow!
- Give me your hand.

1139
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:26,833
Let's go.

1140
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,458
How's it going?

1141
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,333
They're still deciding.

1142
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:48,625
There's not much to decide.
It's not like they can kill me.

1143
01:48:55,416 --> 01:48:56,916
Oh, she gave it back?

1144
01:48:57,458 --> 01:48:58,291
Yeah.

1145
01:49:00,666 --> 01:49:01,875
Talked to Copley.

1146
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,166
Said he could fix it.

1147
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,333
Make it look like I was killed in action.

1148
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:15,583
My family will mourn, but, uh...

1149
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:20,333
They'll be able to move on.

1150
01:49:23,125 --> 01:49:25,083
It's just like what we did with my dad.

1151
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:30,916
I just really want to hear my mom's voice
one more time.

1152
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:36,125
You're a good kid, Nile.

1153
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:40,875
You're gonna be great for the team.

1154
01:50:05,083 --> 01:50:06,458
There's got to be a price.

1155
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:13,958
One hundred years from today,
they'll meet you here.

1156
01:50:16,666 --> 01:50:17,958
Till then, you're alone.

1157
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:27,416
I hoped for less, but...

1158
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:31,000
I expected more.

1159
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:34,250
Nile was gonna let you off
with an apology.

1160
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:41,291
Just give her some time.

1161
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,000
I'm gonna miss you.

1162
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:21,916
Um...

1163
01:51:22,416 --> 01:51:23,791
I won't see you again.

1164
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:30,083
Have a little faith, Book.

1165
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:22,333
This is only what I've found
going back the last 150 years or so.

1166
01:52:26,208 --> 01:52:27,958
When you think about how old you are,

1167
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:33,083
the good you've done for humanity
becomes exponential.

1168
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:36,833
Maybe this is the why, Andy.

1169
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:47,250
It's nearly impossible to disappear
in the world we live in today.

1170
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:52,500
There are too many people like you
who can bend it to your will.

1171
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,583
Too many with bad intentions.

1172
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,875
We don't have all the answers,
but we do have purpose.

1173
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:04,916
And you're going to help us.

1174
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:14,375
When we leave a footprint in the sand,
in the snow, in the ether,

1175
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:15,958
you're going to sweep it.

1176
01:53:16,833 --> 01:53:19,833
You're going to protect us
from those who want to put us in cages,

1177
01:53:19,916 --> 01:53:22,250
and you're gonna help us
find those jobs...

1178
01:53:24,125 --> 01:53:25,791
that are best suited to us.

1179
01:53:28,666 --> 01:53:29,958
She's not asking.

1180
01:53:35,583 --> 01:53:36,416
I'd be honored.

1181
01:53:38,666 --> 01:53:39,916
Then let's go to work.

1182
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:33,708
Booker.

1183
01:54:39,125 --> 01:54:40,875
It's nice to finally meet you.
