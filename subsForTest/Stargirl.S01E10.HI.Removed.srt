Can I get you anything else?

15
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:06,028
-Um, banana split, please.
-I'll try the banana split.

16
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,301
Ha! Cute.

17
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,936
Coming right up, both of you.

18
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:13,105
-Hi.
-Hi.

19
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:15,108
Night owl, huh?

20
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,643
Not usually. I just...

21
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,513
I have lots of paperwork
to finish tonight.

22
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,349
All right. Yeah. I thought
part of being a grownup meant
no more homework. Right?

23
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,150
Yeah. Just selling
my mom's house.

24
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,486
Oh. Yeah, I just... Did she...

25
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,090
-I mean, uh--
-She passed away
a few years ago.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,393
It's been
kind of hard to let go.

27
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,427
-I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,070
You live here?

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,840
Um... I live in California now,

30
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,709
but I grew up
just a few blocks from here.

31
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,543
You?

32
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,977
Oh, I've lived in
a lot of places,

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,947
but I live
in California now, too.

34
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,248
- Van Nuys, right there
in Los Angeles.

35
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:57,849
Me and my boy.

36
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,319
Valley Village.

37
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,155
I'm Barbara, by the way.

38
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,390
Pardon me. Pat.

39
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,293

-Hi.

40
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,062

41
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,764
Well, I'm just kind of
passing through.
I'm on a hunt.

43
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,300

-Yeah.

Would you believe it,

46
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,105
we only have one banana left.

47
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,574
Fred used most of 'em
in the pies.

48
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,210
I'm fine. You take it.
Thank you.

49
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:27,413

-Okay.
-That's a broom.

66
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,826
From Sharper Image.

67
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,430
No. I'm telling her
the truth, Court.
Right now.

68
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,733
Fine. It's not a broom.

69
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,268
-It belonged to Starman.
-It's Dad's.

70
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,703
What?

71
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,938
Would you please just
let me do the explaining--

72
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,307
Dad was a superhero,
and now I'm a superhero, too.

73
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:30,776
Okay. Hey, don't lead
with that.

74
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:34,980
-What that is--
-Jordan Mahkent killed Dad.

75
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,383
What is she talking about?

76
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,585
All right. Just...

77
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:43,118
Let me start at the beginning.

78
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,509
Stripesy?

79
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,611
- You?
- Hmm.

80
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,212
It was a long time ago.

81
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,681
He goes by STRIPE now.

82
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,016
Oh, now? You go by STRIPE now?

83
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,284
Occasionally.

84
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,486
And Jordan Mahkent...

85
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,486
Mom, listen.

86
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,324
Jordan, my boss,
is the iceman.

87
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,660
Icicle.

88
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,894
And he's behind everything bad
going on in Blue Valley.

89
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,029
He killed Dad.

90
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:28,535
Your dad, who was Starman?

91
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,504
Are you crazy?

92
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,439
-Filling my kid's head
with this nonsense?
-Mom!

93
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,040
Telling her that her father
was a superhero?

94
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,576
That Blue Valley's some hideout
for a supervillain gang?

95
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,379
Barbara, I realize
it doesn't make sense

96
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,379
unless you know all the facts--

97
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,749
Pat didn't do anything.

98
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,519
-The Staff chose me.
-Courtney,

99
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,122
-go upstairs.
-Being the Stargirl
is my birthright.

100
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,257
Starman is not your father.

101
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:55,228
I know he told you his name
was Sam Kurtis,

102
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,963
but that was just an alias.

103
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,064
This is my dad.

104
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,500
Sylvester Pemberton.

105
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,735
Starman. He was a member
of the Justice Society.

106
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,870
And the reason
he didn't show up
on Christmas--

107
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:07,040
No, enough!

108
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,408
The proof is right here.

109
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,975
Do not touch that thing.

110
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,211
But, Mom, it--

111
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:16,245
Will you just go to your room,
right now!

112
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:23,857
Look. I realize
that this is a lot to process.

113
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,860
If this lunacy of you being
an assistant superhero--

114
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,995
Sidekick.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,297
I was a sidekick.

116
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,632
If this is remotely true...

117
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,968
then our whole marriage
is a lie.

118
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,240
That's not true, Barb.
Everything we are together
is real.

119
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,141
This family is real.

120
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,512
You dragged my daughter
into this insanity.

121
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,646
You told her that her father
was Starman.

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,983
I wanted this stuff
to stay in the past!

123
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,052
None of this
was supposed to happen!

124
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,355
Tell me one thing, Pat.

125
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,959
One true thing.

126
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,995
When Courtney was hurt,
and you took her
to the hospital...

127
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,365
was that really
from a car accident?

128
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,365
No.

129
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,540
You need to go.

130
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:18,572
-Barbara--
-Get out of this house.

131
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,466
Dad.

132
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,302
I remember.

133
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,569
It was last month,

134
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,603
I remember you
blowing out six candles.

135
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,678
Where have
the last ten years gone?

136
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:57,416
How could I forget ten years?

137
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,319
-I don't know.
-My memory...

138
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,088
It will come back.

139
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,459
It has to.

140
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,730
Why are we here?

141
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,730
You had a seizure.

142
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,298
No. I mean...

143
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,701
in Nebraska?

144
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:19,634
You moved us here
after Mom died.

145
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,809
Merri?

146
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,512
She's...

147
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,581
You don't remember?

148
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,716
A long time ago, um...

149
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,452
there was an accident.

150
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:37,857
She drowned.

151
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,858
I see.

152
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:55,336
She was supposed to pick me up
from school that day.

153
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:03,045
And I was scared that
she had forgotten about me.

154
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,353
You said you found her
in the pool.

155
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:13,038
You said that she was ice cold.

156
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,238
I loved her.

157
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:31,610
Can you hear me, Dad?

158
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,279
Junior?

159
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,482
You have my gift?

160
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,625
Did I know this?

161
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,559
Was I teaching you?

162
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,929
No.

163
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,932
It started when you were
in a coma.

164
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,067
I may have been
trying to reach out,

165
00:08:55,101 --> 00:09:00,052
triggering your
latent abilities.

166
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,576
I know...

167
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,379
how frightening
these powers can be

168
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:10,011
when they first develop.

169
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:15,567
I'm going to help you, son.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,736
- Dad?
- Yeah?

171
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,504
Dad, wait!

172
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,407
Is everything okay with Barb?

173
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,409
I heard her. She sounded upset.

174
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,046
I can't explain it right now,
okay, Mike, but, um...

175
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,182
I'm gonna go spend the night
at the garage.

176
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,684
Just, uh,
get a good night sleep.

177
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,687
All right? And I'll be back
in the morning.

178
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,590
And then what?

179
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,625
Well, Mike...

180
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,461
Uh...

181
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,230
I don't know, Mike.

182
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,600
Wait, uh... Are you guys
gonna get a divorce?

183
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,938
I hope not.

184
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,039
I'll come with you.

185
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,775
-No, it's okay.
-Come on. You're my dad.

186
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:47,312
I'll come with you.

187
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:50,249
Okay. Yeah.

188
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,684
Thanks.

189
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,153
And you know, Mike...

190
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,154
I don't know if I
tell you this enough, but--

191
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,856
Don't get all shaky
on me, big guy.

192
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,490
I'm gonna go pack a bag.

193
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,559
Well...

194
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,062
I love you.

195
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:16,509
Merri...

196
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:20,746
No!

197
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,918
Merri!

198
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,519
Last day...

199
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,721
I loved her...

200
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,724
Drowned... My wife... Last day

201
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,091
So beautiful...

202
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,461
Last day, Jordan, Icicle, Starman...

203
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,398
Dad...

204
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,448
Dad...

205
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,020
Henry.

206
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:28,125
It's good to see you,
old friend.

207
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,712
My wife is dead.

208
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,015
Just like that.

209
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,350
Merri's...

210
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,655
gone.

211
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:12,826
I guess I never talked much
about her, did I?

212
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,163
We met while I was
robbing a bank.

213
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:20,833
A bank, of all things.
Such a cliche.

214
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,970
"Merri... The Girl
of 1,000 Gimmicks,"

215
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,138
the papers called her.

216
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:30,172
And me, the terrible telepath,
"Brainwave."

217
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,279
I was stunned by her thoughts.

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,783
They were so... pure.

219
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,885
So good.

220
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,123
So different
than everyone else's,

221
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,755
it gave me pause.

222
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,563
And she caught me.

223
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:55,235
In more ways than one.

224
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,404
Seeing the world
through Merri's eyes

225
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:03,376
made me question Jordan
and his mission.

226
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,080
But Jordan couldn't allow that.

227
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:12,114
He led the Justice Society
of America to us.

228
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,654
And we killed them.

229
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,323
Including Merri's brother...

230
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,994
Starman.

231
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,162
Starman?

232
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,831
I knew she would
never forgive me

233
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,033
for playing a part in it.

234
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,870
I hoped she would go
into hiding.

235
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,642
But she didn't.

236
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,274
Damn you, Jordan.

237
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:48,317
There are no more
good thoughts to be found.

238
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,325
Merri is dead.

239
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,408
Jordan.

240
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,854
We can't go out right now.

241
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,455
My mom's already too upset.

242
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:25,991
Go back to your crate.

243
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,884
It's taken
the better part of a decade,

244
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,285
but Project: New America

245
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,890
is finally on the precipice
of becoming a reality.

246
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:01,527
Dr. Ito's machine
is near completion.
All it needs now is you.

247
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,863
Your power,

248
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:06,332
and we can take control
of every poisoned mind
in six states.

249
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,768
We'll carve out
the heart of America,

250
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,636
and we'll control it.

251
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,972
Can you imagine, Henry?

252
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,442
Reshaping that many thoughts?

253
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,544
Helping them to see the light.
Our light.

254
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,115
Our way.

255
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,351
What about this "Stargirl"?

256
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,553
The one that put me here?
Who is she?

257
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:11,226
You're not much without
your master, are you?

258
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,469
I'm so curious.

259
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,837
When did you come from?

260
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,643
Is that Starman's staff?

261
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,046
Come with me, Henry.

262
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,078
All your questions
will be answered.

263
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,159
Dr. Ito will help you remember.

264
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,310
What is it?

265
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,904
Nothing.

266
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,369
Where's the Staff?
It's not downstairs!

267
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,939
Well, hopefully, Pat took it.

268
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:29,241
Mom, that Staff
might be the only thing
that can stop Icicle!

269
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,076
And I'm the only one
who can use it!

270
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,811
We're leaving.

271
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,846
Leaving?

272
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,480
I have been up all night.

273
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,550
And I don't know what is true
or what's a lie,

274
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,019
but I know I don't want you
anywhere near Blue Valley.

275
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,922
Or Pat.

276
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,424
Mom, please.

277
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,960
If you'd understand,
he was only trying to help me
get justice for Dad!

278
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,961
Starman was not your father.

279
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,297
You're wrong.

280
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,597
I'm going to work.

281
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,468
Mom, you can't go to work.

282
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,435
Jordan Mahkent is there,
and he killed Dad

283
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,737
and a lot of other people!

284
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,837
So start packing.

285
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,471
I'll be back in an hour.

286
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,075
-Is my staff in there?
-No.

287
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,510
It's not in its crate.

288
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,511
It came to me last night,

289
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,079
and I said
I couldn't go out, and...

290
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,115
Where could it have gone?

291
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,583
I don't know.

292
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,819
We have to find it, and we have
to take the fight to Jordan.

293
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,855
Mom wants
to leave Blue Valley today.

294
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,391
Today?

295
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:53,492
Yeah. She went to the office
to go get her things
and told me to pack up.

296
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,627
I gotta get her out of there.

297
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,296
I told her not to go, but...

298
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,998
-What should I do now?
-Just...

299
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,334
-Listen to your mom.
Go home and pack. Okay?
-But--

300
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,536
-No, Courtney.
-Pat...

301
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,536
That's it. It's over.

302
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,837
It's my fault.

303
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,108
Losing your mother,
that'll hurt forever,
all right?

304
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:12,201
But I can live with it
as long as I know
you're both safe.

305
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,346
Pat...

306
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Hey.

307
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,929
Can you tell me
what's really going on?

308
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,833
I'm sorry, Mike. I...
I can't tell you.

309
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,435
You really never wanted me
and my dad around, did you?

310
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,671
That's not true.

311
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,140
Brothers and sisters
trust each other.

312
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,508
They tell each other
everything.

313
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,643
They help each other.

314
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,176
I know they do, but--

315
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,346
But you're not my sister.

316
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:49,883
I get it.

317
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:50,883
Have a good life, Court.

318
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,252
Mike, no! Mike!

319
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,536
It's all right.

320
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:07,967
Okay.

321
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,769
Courtney!

322
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,361
Henry?

323
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,760
I have so much to say,
and I don't know
where to start.

324
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,365
We killed them.
Including Merri's brother,

325
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,898
Starman.

326
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,300
Damn you, Jordan.

327
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,934
Merri is dead.

328
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,472
Look... I'm sorry!

329
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,240
Stay away from me!

330
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,943
Look! I don't know
what that was.

331
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,945
I could see everything
you were thinking.

332
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,150
Your dad's awake?

333
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,684
Wait!

334
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,520
And your mom was...

335
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,756
Starman's sister?

336
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:07,626
Yeah.

337
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,130
You're my cousin?

338
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,266
We're family.

339
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,001
Uh, we...

340
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,971
We can sort this out
later, right?

341
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,140
Yeah.

342
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,576
Jordan has your staff.

343
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,143
And my dad.

344
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,945
Henry, your dad knows who I am.

345
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,513
He said he was going
to kill my mom.

346
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,450
He can't remember anything
from the last ten years.

347
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,884
What?

348
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,653
He doesn't remember anything
since the day my mother died.

349
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:37,557
I think it hurts him too much.

350
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,627
That's good. I mean... sad.

351
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:45,198
But right now, good.

352
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,566
I need to get my staff back.

353
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,435
And I need to save my dad.

354
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,003
He's different.

355
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,106
I think my mom
was starting to change him.

356
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,840
I saw it.

357
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,310
I felt it.

358
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,212
I bet that's why
Jordan killed her.

359
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:03,282
He killed your mom and my dad.

360
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,950
We are going to need help, too.

361
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,151
Come on.

362
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:15,689
Way to go, Court.
You've just given away
our identities to the enemy.

363
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,022
Henry's not the enemy.

364
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,057
Yes, he is.

365
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:21,094
Look, if it helps,
she didn't tell me anything.

366
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,461
I read her mind.

367
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,330
Which he's not going
to do anymore.

368
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:28,233
That's only polite.

369
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,403
Listen...

370
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:32,638
my mom wants me and her
to leave town today. Forever.

371
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,073
No. You can't go.

372
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,241
I know.

373
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:38,112
But if we find the staff
and are able to stop the ISA,

374
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,813
maybe we can all
only save the town,

375
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,982
but we can also save
Pat and my mom.

376
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:46,486
And save this asshole's dad?

377
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,519
Courtney.

378
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,689
If Brainwave gets
his memories back,

379
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,826
he'll kill you first,
but then we're next.

380
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,228
He'll figure out
all of our identities,

381
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:56,630
unless Junior here
gives us up first.

382
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,598
I'm not telling anybody
anything.

383
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:02,035
We all know
if we find Brainwave,

384
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:05,939
we should break him in two
while we can.

385
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,840
You're not gonna hurt my dad.

386
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:11,176
Yeah? Try and stop me.

387
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,082
Rick.

388
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:19,218
How 'bout you try... right now?

389
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,487
Sit down.

390
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,422
Stand up.

391
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,298
No worries. Just ignore us
like you usually do.

392
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,599
I told you to stay away,
to not touch my friends.

393
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,768
You know what I'll do to you.

394
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:36,702
Hey! Save it for the bad guys.

395
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,904
Henry is the bad guy, Court.

396
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,775
No way I'm working with him.

397
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:42,843
What about Pat?

398
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,076
What's Pat think of all this?

399
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,778
I think he's
with my mom.

400
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:49,348
She was so mad.

401
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,518
We need to do this, everyone.

402
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:56,155
For Court.

403
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,025
The only reason
I'm agreeing to do this

404
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,625
is because I know
you'll do it anyway,

405
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,230
and you need someone
to watch your back.

406
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:07,067
You chose Henry over me,
after all he did.

407
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,967
We're not friends anymore.

408
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,154
You can't be here.

409
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,856
You can't be here.

410
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:35,729
This is literally the most
dangerous place in town.

411
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,564
Hey! You said
you were leaving Blue Valley.

412
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,031
Why are you bothering
with this?

413
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,035
Because Jordan,
and then Sam,
and then Starman.

414
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:44,137
And I don't know
what to think right now.

415
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:46,705
This isn't a mystery
that you need to solve, okay?

416
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,343
Just get Courtney
and go far away. All right?

417
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,846
Oh. Hi, Pat.

418
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,714
- Hello, Barbara.
- Hi.

419
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,383
Don't you look lovely today.

420
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,286
Thank you, Sofus.

421
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,755
Uh, it's nice
to see you here, Pat.

422
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:06,788
Good to see you, too.

423
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:11,530
Pat's still not answering.

424
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,099
Should we wait for him?

425
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,099
We can't.

426
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:19,101
I just hope
him and my mom are okay.

427
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:25,711
So... who wants to go first?

428
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,414
Sorry, I've already been
down here before.

429
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:32,618
Scary.

430
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:33,852
Come on.

431
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:46,165
Chuck?

432
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,167
My goggles kind of still work.

433
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:53,201
I mean, I can see,
but Chuck keeps cutting out.

434
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,442
So no info from Chuck
and no Cosmic Staff.

435
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:57,442
Great.

436
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:13,326
What now?

437
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,760
We split up, I guess.

438
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,296
You'd always say
stick together.

439
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:19,632
We don't have a choice
right now.

440
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,067
Yolanda, Rick,
and Beth, go one way.

441
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,201
Henry and I will go the other.

442
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,503
Oh, I'm not leaving you
alone with him.

443
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,772
No. I'm coming with you.

444
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,442
Fine. Us three
will go this way,

445
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,544
Rick and Beth go that way.

446
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:33,579
We do some recon
and meet back here
in 15 minutes.

447
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:34,663
Got it.

448
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,891
It's to thank you.

449
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,593
For dinner.

450
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,028
That is so thoughtful.

451
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,874
Okay. We have some
family business
to take care of,

452
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,009
but it's good seeing you both.

453
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,644
-Have a nice day.
-Tell those children hello.

454
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:07,614
- We will.
- Okay, bye.

455
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:10,951
Bye, Jordan.

456
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,586
What?

457
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,723
Do you speak Norwegian?

458
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,257
Me either.

459
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,044
I wish you could read my mind.

460
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:41,614
Why would I want to do that?

461
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,049
I know how much I hurt you.

462
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:49,084
And I'd honestly do anything
to take it back.

463
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,088
Well, you can't.

464
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,969
This place
goes on forever.

465
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,372
It's gotta lead somewhere.

466
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,846
What was that?

467
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,248
Let's see.

468
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,826
Rick!

469
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,500
What's in there?

470
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,705
That's Solomon Grundy.

471
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:44,044
That's the thing
that killed my parents.

472
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,489
My dad's close.

473
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,622
I can feel it.

474
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:32,557
Daddy!
 Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, she's here!

475
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:33,993
That bitch is here!

476
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,728
Let me out!
Come on!

477
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,430
I wanna kill here, please?

478
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,530
Please, let me!

479
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:43,036
Please! Now!

480
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,019
Go.

481
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:46,733
What are you doing?

482
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,402
I'm going to rip this door off
and kill that thing.

483
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:49,435
Thought it was obvious.

484
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,936
No, Rick! That's not
why we're here.

485
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,740
Yeah. Change of plans.

486
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,342
Dad!

487
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,061
Henry?

488
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,513
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

489
00:33:33,547 --> 00:33:35,115
I wanna kill her!

490
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,150
Please, please, please, let me!

491
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,884
No, no, no, Daddy!

492
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:39,885
Stargirl.

493
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,487
Daddy, Daddy, no!

494
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:44,523
Snapdragon.

495
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:45,692
Dragon King.

496
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,971
Come on, come on!

497
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,925
It's going to be okay. Come on.

498
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,327
No, Henry.

499
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,298
They already got to you.

500
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,634
They changed you back.

501
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,836
Changed me back?

502
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,739
This is who I am.

503
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,476
Who I've always been.

504
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,045
It's who you are, too.

505
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,179
No!

506
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:25,125
It's too late. Let's go.

507
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:32,065
Please, Rick!
We have to go.

508
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,067
This isn't why we're down here!

509
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,101
Stop!

510
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,804
The others are counting on us!

511
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,177
Rick, who are they?

512
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,315
Who are they?

513
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,820
We should go. We should go!

514
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,820
I'll be back.

515
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,666
We've got company.

516
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,699
Us too. Come on!

517
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,711
I can't believe
you recorded them.

518
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,114
I wanted answers I could trust.

519
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:22,916
I realized I had
to find them myself.

520
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:25,786
I just meant you thinking
to tape the Mahkents,
that was a great idea.

521
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:29,523
I wouldn't have
thought of that.
It was good thinking.

522
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,527
I like her.

523
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,961
You can see
how Jordan looks at her.

524
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,498
It won't matter soon.

525
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:39,710
Once the machine is turned on,

526
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,702
everything will change.

527
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:47,735
What machine?
What are they planning?

528
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,541
-Pat?
-I don't know.

529
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:54,846
Barbara?

530
00:37:28,481 --> 00:37:30,715
I got this.

531
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,052
Here, Beth! Go!

532
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,289
Come on!

533
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:40,393
Courtney, come on!

534
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:45,427
Settle down, children.

535
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:49,202
You can't hide from me.

536
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,411
How about an assist?

537
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,137
Move it.

538
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:11,990
Courtney, come on! Let's go!

539
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:13,693
You first.

540
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,208
Chuck! Can you hear me?

541
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:31,010
You're misdirected,
but you're strong, Henry.

542
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,445
That's good.

543
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:38,784
Stand back!

544
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:48,061
Dad...

545
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,831
listen to me...

546
00:38:50,864 --> 00:38:54,034
I know what these powers
did to you.

547
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:57,637
How they warped
what you believed in.

548
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,574
But people aren't monsters.

549
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,876
I don't want to fight you.

550
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:06,144
I love you.

551
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,081
And I love you.

552
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:10,117
Let me train you.

553
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,717
The power, Henry,
you have no idea--

554
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,387
No.

555
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,822
You're better than this.

556
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:19,525
Mom knew you could be good.

557
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,396
She believed in you!

558
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,865
I know
you loved her.

559
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:27,034
And I know Jordan killed her

560
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:30,704
because she saw
the good in you, too.

561
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,338
Junior.

562
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:37,110
Jordan didn't kill your mother.

563
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:40,146
I did.

564
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:41,547
You?

565
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:43,817
I had to make a choice.

566
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:48,253
Don't make me
choose again, son.

567
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:52,492
Stand by my side now.

568
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,860
Or not at all.

569
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:58,693
I will never stand
by your side.

570
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,083
Good-bye, son.

571
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:25,123
Henry! No!

572
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:32,585
Chuck, come on. Come in.

573
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:40,653
Henry, get up!

574
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,063
I am sorry.

575
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,990
You're right.

576
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,594
People are good.

577
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:06,427
Don't let this change
your mind.
