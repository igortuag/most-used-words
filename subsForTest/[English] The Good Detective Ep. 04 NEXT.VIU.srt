ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS, RELIGIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,017
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,906
EPISODE 4

6
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:39,827
JO SEONG DAE, SERVED 4 YEARS FOR ASSAULT AND THEFT

7
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:41,266
This looks like the guy, right?

8
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,567
Someone sent me Lee Dae Chul's CCTV footage via e-mail.

9
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,637
The detective who was in charge of the case also received it.

10
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:56,177
Had that evidence been submitted at his trial four years ago,

11
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:57,747
the verdict would've been different.

12
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,016
Right.

13
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:03,787
All eyes were on the Lee Dae Chul's case back then,

14
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,386
and it was a game the prosecution had to win no matter what.

15
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,657
The evidence was going to put them at a disadvantage,

16
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,487
so they obviously didn't want to dig their own grave.

17
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,496
Right.

18
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:13,597
Then why...

19
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,666
Why reveal it now?

20
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:18,136
That person...

21
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:21,606
is ruining his career he's built over the years with his own hands.

22
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,606
I'm not so sure about that.

23
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:26,606
Because an innocent person is about to be executed?

24
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:28,306
Because of guilt?

25
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,817
Your recent article...

26
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:34,147
about the families of the victims murdered by the death-row convict.

27
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:36,086
Was that your idea?

28
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,487
Someone put you up to it, right?

29
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,787
The media is only talking about Jo Byeong Gil.

30
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:47,297
People don't even know that Lee Dae Chul will be executed.

31
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:50,097
The person who made you write that article.

32
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,436
What that person wanted wasn't...

33
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:55,306
executing serial killers like Jo Byeong Gil.

34
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,507
What that person wanted was...

35
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:01,776
Lee Dae Chul.

36
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:06,177
Do you know how you can cover up a case most effectively?

37
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:10,947
Making the victim disappear...

38
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,086
forever.

39
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:14,756
Gone.

40
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,397
Your recent article...

41
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,006
about the families of the victims murdered by the death-row convict.

42
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:31,107
Someone put you up to it, right?

43
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,677
It's still off the record.

44
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,346
Let's cover this before it comes out in the open.

45
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:38,776
I'd like you to interview the victims' families.

46
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,917
Would you like to be dropped off where I picked you up?

47
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,186
Yes.

48
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,186
Excuse me.

49
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,496
How do you know the Chief Prosecutor?

50
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,797
It doesn't seem like you work in the prosecution.

51
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,227
I'm just someone who has big respect for him.

52
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,977
He was in jail in the Philippines for robbery and murder.

53
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:08,147
And he was named as the suspect in many cases even after returning.

54
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,806
I bet he killed Park Gun Ho.

55
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:14,786
The problem is, how Park Gun Ho found out about the real culprit.

56
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,846
We must solve that...

57
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,716
to prove how these are linked.

58
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:21,556
But the thing is, Park Gun Ho is dead now.

59
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:25,327
It's likely that he told someone before he died.

60
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:26,897
Who?

61
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:27,996
Lee Eun Hye.

62
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,367
What does she have? Is it a serious condition?

63
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:32,737
She has epilepsy.

64
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,496
It's a chronic condition...

65
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,607
but not serious enough to require hospitalization.

66
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,237
Then why is she hospitalized?

67
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:39,607
Just in case.

68
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:41,776
Once Park Gun Ho is gone, as he did in our case,

69
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,406
she would become the only person...

70
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,846
who may know what he was really thinking.

71
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:49,387
I bet many have told you that they think you're obnoxious.

72
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,756
How would I know? It's not like people will say that to my face.

73
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,987
You are obnoxious.

74
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,357
So obnoxious.

75
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:02,827
How are you feeling?

76
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,336
I heard you haven't been eating the hospital food.

77
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,237
Is there anything you want to eat? I'll pick it up for you.

78
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:15,846
Park Gun Ho has been murdered.

79
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:25,516
Did he say anything to you about the real culprit?

80
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:29,927
You obviously cooperated and did what he told you to do...

81
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:31,756
because there was a valid reason.

82
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,826
Park Gun Ho was on your father's side.

83
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,396
We should find out who killed him, shouldn't we?

84
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:47,837
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

85
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:49,706
- Is she okay?
- Please don't worry. It's nothing.

86
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,706
- What's wrong?
- She's a patient.

87
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:51,777
Get back to your own business.

88
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,277
She's a patient. Are you guys that curious?

89
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,417
I guess it's nothing serious.

90
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,487
Peek in if you're curious. I told you that she's a patient.

91
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:57,787
- I see.
- Is she okay?

92
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,686
Let's wait until she calms down...

93
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,186
and try to talk to her again.

94
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,787
Forget it. Just wait in the car.

95
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,797
You can't persuade that girl by being nice to her.

96
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:09,367
Do you want to see her foam at the mouth and pass out again?

97
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,837
You may not remember this,

98
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,266
but I was the one...

99
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:52,907
who arrested your father five years ago.

100
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:57,847
Do you happen to remember...

101
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,946
the bag of tangerines left on your kitchen table for days...

102
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,787
five years ago?

103
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,756
When I was transferring your father...

104
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,696
to the prosecution after getting his statement,

105
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:15,896
he stopped...

106
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,496
and asked me for a favor.

107
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,337
He said, "My daughter, Eun Hye,"

108
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:24,977
"plays video games for an hour after school,"

109
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,407
"and that's the only thing that gives her joy." He also said...

110
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,347
you always eat tangerines when you do that.

111
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,946
He was worried you'd throw them out if I told you they were from him,

112
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,917
so he asked me...

113
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,027
to just leave them on the kitchen table.

114
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,427
At the time,

115
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,597
I was 100 percent convinced that your father was the culprit.

116
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,837
But at that moment...

117
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,436
In that split second,

118
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,777
I thought to myself that he may not be the culprit.

119
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,547
And I plan to...

120
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,186
I plan to reinvestigate the case...

121
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,696
and find out...

122
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:23,227
why that keeps bothering me.

123
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:27,396
Eun Hye.

124
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,237
Your father...

125
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:36,206
will be executed soon.

126
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:49,617
Did you get anything out of Eun Hye?

127
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:52,587
What did she say?

128
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:56,487
Lee Dae Chul asked Park Gun Ho for a favor.

129
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:58,996
I'm glad.

130
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:02,367
You now know the truth.

131
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:04,827
What?

132
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,996
What do I know?

133
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,567
I'll die anyway even if I'm left alone.

134
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,166
So why...

135
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:14,337
Why do you think he tried to kill me ahead of that?

136
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:18,307
It means someone wants me dead soon.

137
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:22,847
Let's make a deal.

138
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,357
What happened between us...

139
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,886
I'll take it to the grave.

140
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:31,697
Please talk to my daughter Eun Hye in exchange.

141
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,197
Tell her that her father didn't murder anyone.

142
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,977
Please, Officer Park.

143
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:48,506
Officer Park...

144
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,246
Is she your daughter?

145
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:57,717
Yes.

146
00:09:57,717 --> 00:09:59,117
Where is she now?

147
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:02,026
I haven't seen her ever since I was arrested.

148
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,727
She's abandoned you. I don't think she'd believe me even if I met her.

149
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,026
She's my only treasure...

150
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,396
and the only reason for living.

151
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:12,266
Eun Hye knows that.

152
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,896
She's a very sweet girl.

153
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:17,006
She will trust her dad.

154
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,016
Run!

155
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,357
Eun Hye...

156
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:43,266
believes her dad's innocence.

157
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,367
She has to since it's her dad.

158
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,937
Finally, the reason...

159
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:50,136
Park Gun Ho had to die can be explained.

160
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,996
I'll send you the name and address.

161
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,607
I already have his criminal record,

162
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,676
but I want to know what Jo Seong Dae has been up to, what he does,

163
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,337
and where he is usually seen.

164
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,577
It's okay if it takes time. Please look into it.

165
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,617
Yes, thank you.

166
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,217
Why are you suddenly drinking at home?

167
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:11,746
We aren't here to drink,

168
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,886
but didn't have anywhere else to talk.

169
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:16,357
I'm on leave so can't go to the station...

170
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:19,626
and I wanted you to meet my new partner.

171
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,526
Hello.

172
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,307
Why did you become a detective...

173
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:35,947
when you're so handsome?

174
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,477
Many detectives nowadays...

175
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,977
look better than I do.

176
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,786
That's why I'm asking. I'd like to ask all of them.

177
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:45,886
Detectives should look beat up like him.

178
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:49,187
Stop being ridiculous and leave us. We need to discuss something.

179
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:52,156
Don't drink too much. I bought it for myself.

180
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:53,396
Leave us already.

181
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:56,126
I can smell alcohol on your breath. It's embarrassing,

182
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,097
so go inside, please.

183
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,597
You crazy...

184
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,006
Has she lost her mind?

185
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:05,876
- Keep it to a bottle.
- Okay.

186
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:10,847
- Would you like a drink?
- No, I drove.

187
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:23,756
Do you remember when...

188
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:27,926
Park Gun Ho faked a seizure in the holding cell?

189
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,996
He knew of Eun Hye's illness.

190
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:32,437
He wanted to tell us...

191
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:35,367
that we made Eun Hye sick.

192
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:39,237
Why do you think Park Gun Ho is right?

193
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:42,347
I don't think he's right,

194
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,707
but I think I know...

195
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,416
why he thought Lee Dae Chul is innocent.

196
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:48,916
Then...

197
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,916
do you think Lee Dae Chul is innocent?

198
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,587
Your opinion is more important than mine.

199
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:56,426
What do you think?

200
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,926
I thought Lee Dae Chul was guilty until now,

201
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:04,197
but from now on I'm going to forget about that thought.

202
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,597
I'm going back to when I first faced the case.

203
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,036
Lee Dae Chul is neither guilty nor innocent.

204
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,406
What if Lee Dae Chul's innocence is proved?

205
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:16,307
Then we'll have to save him.

206
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:26,756
The person who made you write that article.

207
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:28,286
What that person wanted wasn't...

208
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,256
executing serial killers like Jo Byeong Gil.

209
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:33,526
What that person wanted was...

210
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:35,766
Lee Dae Chul.

211
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:51,176
Mr. Yoo.

212
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,416
Oh, you're here.

213
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,286
Is something weighing you down?

214
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:58,957
Would you like some tea?

215
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,296
Is something up?

216
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:09,567
- Let's have a seat.
- Okay.

217
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:14,697
Is it bad?

218
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:15,737
Reporter Jin.

219
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:20,237
I think I'll be able to keep the promise I made you.

220
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:24,146
You start working here tomorrow. The director approved of it.

221
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,687
The team here can be territorial.

222
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:34,286
Yes, I've prepared myself for that.

223
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,286
Then why did you look so down?

224
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:41,756
You don't have to come if you're comfortable where you are.

225
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,166
Are you kidding me?

226
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,867
Are you trying to tease me?

227
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,467
Fine, let's be a good team.

228
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,766
Okay.

229
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,107
Shouldn't I buy you a drink? I also have something to tell you.

230
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:58,176
I have plans...

231
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,217
Okay, next time then.

232
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:02,886
No, you can come with me.

233
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:12,597
Aren't you being harassed nowadays?

234
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,097
Excuse me?

235
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:16,766
Those against the death penalty...

236
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,136
must have ripped you apart.

237
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:21,837
Reporters should take that as something normal.

238
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:24,307
Anyway, thank you.

239
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:25,707
Excuse me?

240
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:30,107
The current government promised to abolish the death penalty.

241
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,217
They will be keeping that promise sooner or later.

242
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,646
The problem is the prisoners on death row.

243
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,786
They may have to let a murderer...

244
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,656
that killed 11 people live.

245
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,327
In order to abolish the death penalty,

246
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,557
we needed to execute the death-row convicts.

247
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:47,957
We had to have the people know that it is the right thing to do.

248
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:51,126
That's why you needed my article.

249
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:53,237
I'll be honest with you.

250
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:57,766
I'll probably become the next Minister of Justice.

251
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,937
The death penalty will be abolished during my term.

252
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,847
Before I take office,

253
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,107
I needed to get rid of anything...

254
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,077
that would cause a political problem for me.

255
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:10,946
You should be the one buying me a drink.

256
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:15,386
I understand. Family comes first.

257
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,757
Thank you for understanding.

258
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:19,426
However,

259
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:22,767
couldn't you have hidden your intentions to the end?

260
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:25,497
You'd find out even if I tried to hide it.

261
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,436
I told you before you caught on.

262
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,807
I know this is out of the blue, but...

263
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:33,777
Isn't that the real question you had for me?

264
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:35,876
Is there...

265
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:39,446
something between you and Chief Prosecutor Kim...

266
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:41,317
that I don't know about?

267
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,247
There's something between him and my brother, not me.

268
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,716
They were rivals since they were in school.

269
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:50,686
They both think they have to bring the other one down...

270
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,597
to be able to become successful.

271
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,327
It's the relationship they have.

272
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:00,997
Would you like another drink?

273
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,966
No, it's my first day at the head office.

274
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:07,136
I can't show up with a drunk, puffy face.

275
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,247
All right. See you at the office tomorrow.

276
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,787
Wait.

277
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,587
Is my job at the head office...

278
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:23,686
a personal gift from you?

279
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:25,997
We...

280
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,626
aren't close enough to give each other gifts.

281
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,666
Of course.

282
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,636
See you tomorrow!

283
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,067
Hello, come in.

284
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:58,057
SEOBU POLICE STATION

285
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,857
Superintendent Moon wants to see me.

286
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:04,166
I'm sure he'll throw a fit about us being drunk on the job.

287
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:06,837
He might want to talk to you too,

288
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:08,436
so let's get our stories straight.

289
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:12,236
We don't have to tell every detail about...

290
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,476
why we were drinking to the superintendent.

291
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,047
I am going to tell them the truth.

292
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:18,107
Hey!

293
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,176
Detective Kang didn't give up on this case.

294
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,486
I'm going to follow Detective Kang with confidence.

295
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:23,787
Gosh...

296
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:27,656
Jae Hong, we are going to get scorned at this rate.

297
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:29,857
We all might get replaced.

298
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,156
Okay. I get it.

299
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:33,357
Just go talk to the superintendent.

300
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:34,757
I am counting on you.

301
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:39,696
Good luck, sir.

302
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:42,466
Hey, Shim Dong Wook

303
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:45,676
- Yes?
- I am warning you.

304
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,376
Just because others are being sassy to Chief, doesn't mean you can too.

305
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:51,847
You are not in a position to do so.

306
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,946
Hey, Kwon Jae Hong.

307
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:56,486
When I checked with the patrol,

308
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,787
they said Kang Do Chang and Oh Ji Hyuk were aware of...

309
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:00,486
a possible case when they arrived at the site.

310
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:03,186
Were they in touch with Park Gun Ho all this time?

311
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:06,757
Well, I don't think so.

312
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:09,267
Other than that, the situation doesn't match up.

313
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,997
I just remembered something.

314
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,236
This is a secret but...

315
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,136
Do Chang...

316
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:21,476
saw Park Gun Ho getting murdered at that very site...

317
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:23,906
in his dream.

318
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,646
What are you doing to Chief?

319
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:35,787
Chief, if you like to know who the culprit of this case is,

320
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,287
call Do Chang.

321
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,456
He just got possessed by a spirit,

322
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,827
so he is very skilled in that sense.

323
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:46,966
I believe he can tell the future.

324
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:58,577
Do Chang, you don't look like someone on vacation.

325
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,517
Smile.

326
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,916
Okay.

327
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:05,617
Ready? 1,2,3.

328
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:09,226
I understand why detectives drink while working.

329
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,186
When I was doing the fieldwork,

330
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,527
I got called to sites while I was drinking at night.

331
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:20,196
That doesn't mean that I don't understand Chief Nam Guk Hyun.

332
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,736
He should be like that as a chief.

333
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:24,767
Furthermore, it is a murder scene.

334
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:27,307
The problem is the fact that you got caught.

335
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:29,747
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Either way,

336
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:33,376
if that continuously gets mentioned by Chief Nam Guk Hyun,

337
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,087
I can't keep it quiet as a superintendent.

338
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:39,317
Do you understand the position that I'm in right now?

339
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,317
Yes.

340
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,327
For now, there won't be any disciplinary punishment.

341
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,557
If you get punished for something like this,

342
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:48,456
this will make it difficult to control all the detectives.

343
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:52,466
However, your team needs to help out Chief Nam...

344
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,196
in investigating Park Gun Ho.

345
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,867
That way, Chief Nam will not make a big deal out of it.

346
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,206
Yes, of course.

347
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:04,946
By the way, I heard that Kang Do Chang was at the scene too.

348
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:07,416
Did he not tell you that I sent him on vacation?

349
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,416
No, he told me about it.

350
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,686
Is he still attached to Lee Dae Chul's case?

351
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:11,686
No, that is not it.

352
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:14,986
Then why does a person on vacation show up at the crime scene?

353
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:16,857
I told him to take a break but why isn't he taking one?

354
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,787
About that...

355
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:20,726
Excuse me, sir.

356
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:24,196
ON VACATION NOW. I'M SORRY THAT I AM HAVING FUN BY MYSELF.

357
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,337
KANG DO CHANG

358
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:32,406
Kang Do Chang is having fun right now.

359
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:39,976
- That is a lot of fish.
- Right?

360
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:45,186
- Have fun fishing.
- Thank you.

361
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,787
I can't believe this.

362
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,757
I'm even fabricating an alibi when I am a detective.

363
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:54,527
Thank you for your help.

364
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:59,767
Jo Seong Dae has an office in Ansan, Gyeonggi-do.

365
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:02,196
He runs a company under his own name?

366
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:04,367
I guess he does have the guts.

367
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,037
We might catch him sooner than we thought.

368
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:07,476
I think it won't be easy.

369
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:10,646
If he is exposing that much about himself,

370
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,507
he must be confident enough...

371
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:13,946
to not get caught.

372
00:23:17,617 --> 00:23:19,416
SOMEONE ELSE'S SISTER IN THE NEXT LIFE

373
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:27,497
What now? What is it this time?

374
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:28,926
I want to kill myself.

375
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:31,997
Should I really kill myself?

376
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:33,166
Where are you now?

377
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,337
I am at the police station.

378
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:36,607
Were you drinking and causing trouble in the daylight again?

379
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:37,767
That jerk!

380
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,607
That jerk filed a restraining order against me.

381
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:44,807
I went to see Jae Woong, and I got arrested by the police.

382
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,777
A mother went to see her own son...

383
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:49,617
and got arrested by the police.

384
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:52,347
Is it illegal to go to see my own son?

385
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:54,886
Is that what the law states?

386
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:56,587
Say something!

387
00:23:57,057 --> 00:24:01,557
Say something! You haughty Korean police officer!

388
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:29,686
You should come with me.

389
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:33,926
I think I might end up killing a person right now.

390
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:35,327
Let's go.

391
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:38,997
Who is it?

392
00:24:38,997 --> 00:24:40,666
Is that you, Jae Woong?

393
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,206
It's me, your uncle. Detective uncle.

394
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,607
Jae Woong, look at your face.

395
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,587
Have you been going to school?

396
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,287
Have you been eating well?

397
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:07,696
What happened to your face? Why do you look so haggard?

398
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:09,567
Do you miss your mom?

399
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:11,497
Where is dad?

400
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:15,497
He is not here.

401
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:24,876
That jerk. He made a little kid a liar.

402
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:26,547
Jae Woong.

403
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:30,317
You remember your favorite tteokbokki place, right?

404
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:33,886
Go and eat tteokbokki, fish cake, and whatever you want.

405
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:36,986
And after that, go hang out in the playground.

406
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:38,886
Go on. Come back when you're done.

407
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:52,267
You jerk! I am going to kill you!

408
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,376
Excuse me.

409
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:58,976
Can I get a cup of water?

410
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:01,946
I am a co-worker who works with Detective Kang.

411
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,527
I am sorry.

412
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,067
I am really sorry.

413
00:26:19,736 --> 00:26:22,807
Honestly, isn't it too harsh to file a restraining order...

414
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,906
against the child's mother?

415
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:28,507
Do Chang, this is the only way she will pull it together.

416
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:29,847
But she is the child's mother.

417
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,007
It is normal for a mother to want to see her own son.

418
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,617
I am begging you.

419
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:36,787
Please tell her to stop interfering with my life.

420
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:38,787
She is so annoying!

421
00:26:38,787 --> 00:26:41,986
She is an obstacle in my life. A really big obstacle.

422
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,186
Still...

423
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:48,057
She used to live with you under the same roof.

424
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,626
Exactly.

425
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,166
Since I lived with her under the same roof,

426
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,896
shouldn't you be thanking me for it?

427
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:58,206
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:00,476
I will clean it up.

429
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:02,176
Where is the broom?

430
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,646
Gosh...

431
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:06,916
I found a rag.

432
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,117
I understand that you hate her,

433
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:11,986
and that is why you divorced her.

434
00:27:11,986 --> 00:27:16,057
But is there a particular reason you need to live with Jae Woong?

435
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:17,986
Wouldn't it be better if you leave Jae Woong with his mom...

436
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:21,456
and you live your own life?

437
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:23,466
You think I don't know that?

438
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:26,837
Also, what money does she have to take care of Jae Woong?

439
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:27,837
I can...

440
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,936
I can take care of them.

441
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:33,476
I have the capability to do so.

442
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:34,476
Are you sure?

443
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:36,607
Darn it.

444
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,847
Hey...

445
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:46,956
Why don't you just take a look at this?

446
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:49,317
The court sent it to me a while ago.

447
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:53,196
It says that they are going to investigate my bank statement.

448
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:55,757
Because you are under investigation for corruption.

INCHEON DISTRICT COURT

450
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:59,196
Looking at this, how could I...

451
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:03,067
trust anybody to take care of my son?

452
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:14,117
That's enough.

453
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:16,587
Do Chang.

454
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:26,327
Ji Hyuk.

455
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:30,997
I have to go somewhere.

456
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,166
So you should investigate...

457
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,297
about Jo Seong Dae's whereabouts.

458
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:36,867
Okay.

You are such a jerk!

463
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:10,706
How could you do this to me?

464
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,567
How could you be so cold-hearted?

465
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,206
- How dare you?
- Come with me.

We'll be in touch.

471
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,007
Okay, thank you.

472
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:28,747
Excuse me. Is the owner here at the moment?

473
00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:29,787
Well...

474
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,146
Can I help you?

475
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,517
Hello, I'm here to see the owner.

476
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:34,857
Why do you need to see my boss?

477
00:30:34,857 --> 00:30:37,986
I'd like to speak with him in person.

478
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,226
He's abroad at the moment.

479
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,827
What are you talking about? I saw him yesterday.

480
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,436
Jo Seong Dae is inside, right?

481
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,966
You'd better get out while I'm still being nice to you.

482
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,267
You see,

483
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,007
I have to see him today.

484
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:56,277
Do you know how much money he borrowed from me and ran off?

485
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:59,507
I'm giving you the last chance to walk out of here on your own.

486
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:00,817
One.

487
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:02,547
Two.

488
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:03,847
Three.

489
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:11,726
Who is that jerk?

490
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:14,357
Hey. Darn it. Get out of there.

491
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:15,956
Unlock the door!

492
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,626
Hey, who are you?

493
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,997
WE ARE HIRING.

494
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:28,107
CEO JO SEONG DAE

495
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:50,327
KIM GI TAE, PROSECUTION SERVICE

496
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:00,337
Do you have a death wish?

497
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,976
What should we start with?

498
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,676
First, I'll break those rude fingers of yours.

499
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:06,047
Whack him!

500
00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:11,216
You little...

501
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:14,916
Kill him!

502
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,656
I got him.

503
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:18,626
Whack him!

504
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:24,267
How dare you.

505
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:28,037
Hey, quick.

506
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:29,807
- Hey, just kill him.
- Gosh.

507
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:31,267
You scumbag!

508
00:32:58,196 --> 00:33:01,367
Excuse me, please don't tell your boss about this.

509
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:03,966
Those guys will get fired for not doing their job.

510
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,476
Hey, get this off me.

511
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:13,547
Get this off me, please.

512
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,547
I can't believe...

513
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:19,216
you even went through my brother-in-law's bank account.

514
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:23,827
Checking family members' accounts is part of the normal procedure.

515
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:27,027
My sister is actually divorced now, so that jerk is no longer my family.

516
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,827
You didn't even do that much research?

517
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:30,396
I have confirmed that they're now divorced.

518
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:32,726
However, the alleged corruption...

519
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:34,166
took place before they got a divorce.

520
00:33:34,966 --> 00:33:36,436
My sister is in...

521
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:38,666
a child custody battle with her ex-husband at the moment.

522
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,406
She has nothing.

523
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:43,876
The only person she can rely on is me, who also has nothing.

524
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:46,047
She was already losing the custody battle over my nephew,

525
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,747
and you basically gave her ex-husband a knife to slay her.

526
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:50,946
Do you realize what you have done?

527
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,617
I was simply drawing the line between work and personal matters.

528
00:33:55,357 --> 00:33:57,057
You see,

529
00:33:58,057 --> 00:34:00,126
when you feel pressured, threatened,

530
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:02,396
and cornered,

531
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:04,997
you can't help but doubt people.

532
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,797
"Why did that happen to that person at that specific timing?"

533
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,236
"Back then, I thought it was just a coincidence."

534
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:14,606
"How come I now feel as though I can see that person's intentions?"

535
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:19,446
I'll probably have to turn my back on a junior officer I'm close to...

536
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,517
so that I, too, can keep personal matters separate from work.

537
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:27,216
Why does this sound like a threat to me?

538
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,457
You see, only those who are holding the knife can make threats.

539
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:33,426
Had I been afraid of those with a knife,

540
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:36,057
I would've left the force a long time ago.

541
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:41,167
SEOBU DETENTION HOUSE

542
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,537
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

543
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,776
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KIM GI TAE

544
00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:59,017
SEOBU DETENTION HOUSE

545
00:35:16,066 --> 00:35:17,307
Hello, Detective Oh.

546
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:20,877
Hi. I came to meet with Kim Gi Tae, the former chief prosecutor.

547
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:22,707
The former chief prosecutor, Kim Gi Tae?

548
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:24,446
Why?

549
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:26,046
Park Gun Ho's phone has been retrieved.

550
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:27,316
What?

551
00:35:27,316 --> 00:35:29,446
Like Park Gun Ho had said, there were some photos on the phone.

552
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:31,086
We identified the person in the photos.

553
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:32,847
It's a man named Jo Seong Dae.

554
00:35:32,946 --> 00:35:34,256
Jo Seong Dae?

555
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:37,426
I found Kim Gi Tae's business card on his desk,

556
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,057
so those two must be connected.

557
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,557
I called you because I was wondering...

558
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,667
if you met Jo Seong Dae or heard anything about him...

559
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,196
while investigating Kim Gi Tae.

560
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:47,397
Not that I recall.

561
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,336
I've never heard of such a name.

562
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:53,037
All right. I'll send you a photo of him. Please let me know.

563
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,406
Okay.

564
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,606
I'm on my way to the detention house as well,

565
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:58,106
so let's talk there.

566
00:35:58,106 --> 00:35:59,606
All right, I'll wait for you.

567
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:04,386
I heard...

568
00:36:04,386 --> 00:36:08,086
you reached out to Mr. Kim this time saying you'd like to speak with him.

569
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:09,256
Correct.

570
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:11,327
What is it regarding?

571
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:12,957
There's something I need to check.

572
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:19,796
DETECTIVE OH JI HYUK

573
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:23,167
DETECTIVE OH JI HYUK

574
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:39,347
Reporter Jin.

575
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,486
Yes?

576
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,156
You're not wearing your seat belt.

577
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:45,656
- Oh, right.
- They even check the back seat now.

578
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:46,997
Put on the seat belt, please.

579
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:48,356
Okay.

580
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:05,546
You've gone off route. Recalculating the route.

581
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,117
- Why...
- You see,

582
00:37:09,117 --> 00:37:11,117
it zones out like that from time to time.

583
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:13,086
Don't worry.

584
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:16,957
I definitely know my way around from here on.

585
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:27,636
I'm sorry,

586
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:31,207
but can we stop by that gas station for a moment?

587
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,406
I really need to use the washroom.

588
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,636
Can you hold it?

589
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:35,877
We're almost there.

590
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:39,247
I really need to go. Please.

591
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,716
Why do I suddenly have an upset stomach?

592
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:44,917
All right, then.

593
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:53,156
SIMBOK GAS STATION

594
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,497
The washroom is over there. Gosh, my stomach...

595
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:04,037
WASHROOM

596
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:08,906
Hey.

597
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:11,176
The office?

598
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:12,906
Who?

599
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:36,037
I'm with the man in that photo.

600
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,667
Yes, that's right. The man named Jo Seong Dae.

601
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,276
Please hurry.

602
00:38:40,676 --> 00:38:41,736
Where am I now?

603
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:44,807
It's a gas station.

604
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:47,046
I forgot to check the name because I was too flustered.

605
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,046
What?

606
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:50,486
Okay.

607
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:52,886
I'll check the location and send it to you.

608
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:54,716
Please hurry.

609
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:01,526
Gosh, why isn't this getting a signal?

610
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:04,867
There.

611
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:12,207
SIMBOK GAS STATION

612
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:15,307
DETECTIVE OH JI HYUK

613
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:19,276
SIMBOK GAS STATION

614
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:49,276
Please don't kill me.

615
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:00,547
Please don't kill me.

616
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:03,348
Whom did you call?

617
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:05,018
It's just...

618
00:40:06,078 --> 00:40:07,587
someone from work.

619
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,958
DETECTIVE OH JI HYUK

620
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:19,728
DETECTIVE OH JI HYUK

621
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,868
Detective Oh Ji Hyuk.

622
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,067
POWER OFF

623
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:35,448
Let's get going now.

624
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:38,917
WASHROOM

625
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:42,087
SIMBOK GAS STATION

626
00:40:48,187 --> 00:40:49,257
Reporter Jin.

627
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:54,828
Forget about...

628
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:57,698
- what just went through your mind.
- I'm a reporter,

629
00:40:57,698 --> 00:40:59,038
a reporter with Junghan Daily.

630
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:02,138
It'll be tough to clean up if anything happens to me.

631
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:04,607
We ran out of time.

632
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:08,748
The hours are designated for special visits.

633
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:38,277
You should get in the habit of wearing a seatbelt.

634
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:46,547
Seriously?

635
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:53,618
What's going on, Mister?

636
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:54,647
What's that?

637
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,978
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

638
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:16,127
- What's this?
- A suspect.

639
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,567
- For what?
- We're still investigating it.

640
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:21,837
I'll tell you when it's over.

641
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:33,118
EVIDENCE

642
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:35,587
Did you kill Park Gun Ho with this knife?

643
00:44:39,187 --> 00:44:41,527
This isn't a knife you use on people.

644
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,357
You threatened a reporter with it.

645
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,757
She said she was locked in the bathroom,

646
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:49,127
so I just used it to open the lock.

647
00:44:50,268 --> 00:44:52,297
- What else?
- Starting today,

648
00:44:53,397 --> 00:44:54,607
we'll count the days.

649
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:57,777
Once I get a hold of something, I never let go.

650
00:44:57,777 --> 00:44:59,607
Not until the target is in a prisoner's uniform.

651
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:05,877
That knife.

652
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:10,317
You'll give it back when the investigation is over, right?

653
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,127
I'm quite attached to it.

654
00:45:22,897 --> 00:45:24,567
I'm sure he's a murderer.

655
00:45:25,337 --> 00:45:27,437
I've never sensed such a violent temper in my life.

656
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:31,208
I'm not biased because he killed Park Gun Ho.

657
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,507
I really...

658
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:36,877
thought I might die there.

659
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:40,018
All right. Go home and get some rest.

660
00:45:40,118 --> 00:45:42,118
I'll call you later if I need you to testify.

661
00:45:43,717 --> 00:45:44,717
Thank you.

662
00:45:46,687 --> 00:45:50,388
You did the right thing to call patrol cars.

663
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:52,857
But it was reckless of you...

664
00:45:52,857 --> 00:45:54,368
to block a speeding car,

665
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:56,567
although you saved my life by doing so.

666
00:45:58,638 --> 00:46:00,268
I was going to shoot the gun.

667
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:03,007
I would have if he came any closer.

668
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:05,877
I was in the car too.

669
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:07,848
Didn't you think you could've hurt me?

670
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,277
If you shoot the driver,

671
00:46:09,277 --> 00:46:10,377
the car could overturn...

672
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:12,248
or hit another car.

673
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,487
Come to think about it,

674
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:17,158
you're right.

675
00:46:17,717 --> 00:46:18,817
What did you just say?

676
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:26,958
The briefing for Park Gun Ho's case is starting now.

677
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:30,228
At approximately 4pm on November 28,

678
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:33,937
Park Gun Ho was found dead at Haehwa Apartment in Incheon.

679
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:35,437
SEOBU POLICE STATION

680
00:46:36,937 --> 00:46:38,678
We have come to the conclusion...

681
00:46:38,937 --> 00:46:41,607
that Park Gun Ho committed suicide, jumping to his death.

682
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,078
Do you know why he committed suicide?

683
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:44,317
Was there a will?

684
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:45,647
No, there was no will.

685
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,587
However, we believe that the fear of...

686
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:50,917
having to do prison time for what he recently did...

687
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,018
was the reason he committed suicide.

688
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,158
He was booked without detention.

689
00:46:55,288 --> 00:46:58,397
Why would he have felt pressured in that situation?

690
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:00,667
Park Gun Ho used to be a correctional officer.

691
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:02,428
He must have been terrified of...

692
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:04,237
being locked up with prisoners he used to supervise.

693
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:06,737
Does the coroner that performed the autopsy agree with you?

694
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:08,567
There was a cut on his thigh.

695
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:12,277
However, his body was found in a deserted apartment.

696
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:14,808
The coroner mentioned the cut could have occurred...

697
00:47:14,808 --> 00:47:16,507
from some kind of metal during his fall.

698
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:17,547
Who performed the autopsy?

699
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:20,817
Why do you think Park Gun Ho was at the deserted apartment?

700
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:27,118
I've never seen such a forced investigation.

701
00:47:27,228 --> 00:47:29,357
He is determined to cover up the case.

702
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:32,027
Is it okay for the police to do this?

703
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:34,897
What will happen to Jo Seong Dae?

704
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:36,928
If the case is closed as a suicide,

705
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:39,737
Jo Seong Dae won't be a suspect anymore.

706
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,007
We'll have to let him go.

707
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,737
Think about what he did to me.

708
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:43,908
You can't let him go like that.

709
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:45,908
All we have on him is threatening.

710
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:47,877
He could have killed me.

711
00:47:48,377 --> 00:47:50,007
You don't know what he'll do to me.

712
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:52,948
Reporters are similar to detectives, aren't they?

713
00:47:53,518 --> 00:47:55,917
You should quit your job if you can't take that risk.

714
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,158
Reporters don't have guns, but detectives do!

715
00:47:58,158 --> 00:47:59,717
You look disappointed.

716
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:04,928
Gosh, I am too.

717
00:48:05,428 --> 00:48:07,928
If it were a murder case like you said,

718
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:10,467
it was a good opportunity to score extra points.

719
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:20,978
Even if the higher-ups gave him an order,

720
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:23,308
don't you think he's going too far?

721
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:25,018
I have a feeling he's closely related to...

722
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:26,717
the case from five years ago.

723
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:28,917
He was the detective in charge of Lee Dae Chul's case...

724
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:31,388
and the partner of Detective Jang Jin Soo, who got killed.

725
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,917
Those two were partners?

726
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:37,397
I'm at home. I took a little nap.

727
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:41,098
I know that place. I'll take a taxi.

728
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,928
I'll arrive in about 30 minutes.

729
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,908
After getting drunk and throwing a tantrum last night,

730
00:48:48,538 --> 00:48:50,007
how can you drink from the morning?

731
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:52,237
Can't you put that jerk behind bars?

732
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,678
You're a cop.

733
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:55,408
I can't unless he's guilty.

734
00:48:55,408 --> 00:48:58,777
Just make something up and arrest him.

735
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:01,587
Other cops do that all the time. Why can't you?

736
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,147
Do you think that makes sense?

737
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:04,917
I just talked to him on the phone.

738
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:08,428
They checked his bank accounts while doing a background check on you.

739
00:49:08,558 --> 00:49:11,527
That's why he got mad and did that to me.

740
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:14,268
I didn't do anything wrong. It just happened that way.

741
00:49:14,268 --> 00:49:17,467
You must have done something to make them do a check on you.

742
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:21,208
So why can't you arrest that jerk already?

743
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:25,678
Can't a cop do that much for his little sister?

744
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:27,408
Just drink.

745
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,678
Leave me alone. I didn't do anything wrong.

746
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:32,377
What about me?

747
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,547
I can't see Jae Woong for the rest of my life?

748
00:49:36,317 --> 00:49:37,757
I miss him.

749
00:49:38,987 --> 00:49:40,558
I want to touch him.

750
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:44,127
It's driving me crazy, Do Chang.

751
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:45,828
Please.

752
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:56,268
That's the only way I can think of.

753
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:59,138
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:00,578 --> 00:50:02,308
But I can't do that.

755
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:05,478
A cop shouldn't do that.

756
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:07,348
Never.

757
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:15,987
Isn't that strange?

758
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:18,857
He's going out with his dead partner's wife?

759
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,737
Maybe they got close while he was trying to comfort her.

760
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:29,167
I doubt Detective Oh would have such a naive view on the matter.

761
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:33,237
Detective Jang pursued Lee Dae Chul...

762
00:50:33,437 --> 00:50:35,478
even though he had an alibi.

763
00:50:37,178 --> 00:50:39,047
He must have been bought off by someone.

764
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:41,987
It's highly likely that his partner, Nam Guk Hyun, was in it too.

765
00:50:42,788 --> 00:50:43,917
Those two must have shared something with each other...

766
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:46,018
instead of her dead husband.

767
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:53,397
What's the matter?

768
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:54,527
Search everywhere.

769
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:57,098
They're searching your desk and everything.

770
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:59,138
Did you do something to upset the higher-ups again?

771
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:00,768
Hey, stop!

772
00:51:00,768 --> 00:51:02,337
You said you'd only search Kang Do Chang's desk.

773
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:03,667
Stay away from the others' desks!

774
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,478
We're only following the orders.

775
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,547
- What are you doing?
- They're searching...

776
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:09,277
everyone's desk now!

777
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:11,248
They're all clean. It'll be fine.

778
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:14,487
What if they find something even if it's something trivial?

779
00:51:15,587 --> 00:51:16,618
Fine.

780
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:20,317
Whatever they find, I'll take responsibility for it. Don't worry.

781
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:21,458
All right.

782
00:51:23,328 --> 00:51:26,098
That sly jerk.

783
00:51:27,158 --> 00:51:28,527
What's wrong?

784
00:51:29,098 --> 00:51:31,797
Fine, bring it on.

785
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:35,737
I'll get to the bottom of things by all means.

786
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:37,678
You little rat.

787
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:43,678
PROJECT REPORT

788
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,377
Don't let it bother you.

789
00:51:47,118 --> 00:51:49,087
It's fine as long as we have nothing to hide.

790
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:53,257
It's just that I feel humiliated.

791
00:51:53,257 --> 00:51:56,158
Why are they only going after us? Let's face it,

792
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,658
everyone knows those jerks take bribes all the time.

793
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,598
Why check us out...

794
00:52:00,598 --> 00:52:02,598
while leaving them alone? Why?

795
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:05,437
It was all just for show.

796
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:07,507
Otherwise, why would they take a whole hour?

797
00:52:07,507 --> 00:52:09,138
It could have been done in ten minutes.

798
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:11,208
They wanted everyone to see it.

799
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:13,408
They wanted to humiliate us.

800
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:15,647
It was all just for show. Don't worry.

801
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:18,618
Chief, something smells fishy.

802
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:22,248
Why would they do this while Do Chang is on vacation?

803
00:52:22,248 --> 00:52:25,487
The way they treated Park Gun Ho's case was ridiculous too.

804
00:52:25,587 --> 00:52:28,558
Could they have done this to stop us from questioning...

805
00:52:28,558 --> 00:52:30,058
Park Gun Ho's case?

806
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:31,598
Gosh, you're delusional.

807
00:52:34,098 --> 00:52:35,297
You idiots.

808
00:52:35,397 --> 00:52:38,067
Do you think what you're doing is so important?

809
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:41,167
In the higher-ups' eyes, you're mere minnows.

810
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:43,507
Why would they even care about us? They just...

811
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:45,678
did it. For no reason.

812
00:52:45,678 --> 00:52:47,777
And we were just unlucky.

813
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:51,817
Stop overthinking. Know your place, you fools.

814
00:52:52,848 --> 00:52:57,248
Hey, there's no need to put ourselves down.

815
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:59,857
All we have to do is have a drink...

816
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:01,958
and forget everything.

817
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,458
That's how we roll, right?

818
00:53:03,757 --> 00:53:05,558
Let's go. The drinks are on me.

819
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,928
Forget it. I'm going home.

820
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:09,397
Are you sure?

821
00:53:09,928 --> 00:53:13,998
Then should we go without him?

822
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:18,937
Why couldn't he just let it lie?

823
00:53:19,377 --> 00:53:21,877
It's not like he can handle everything himself.

824
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:26,047
Why does he have to cause everyone trouble?

825
00:53:27,277 --> 00:53:29,448
Gosh, this is frustrating.

826
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,388
Be careful not to drink too much.

827
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:38,527
Don't you dare make a scene again.

828
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:40,698
- Let me pour you one.
- Chief.

829
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:43,567
I know I'm inexperienced,

830
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,498
but isn't the situation...

831
00:53:45,937 --> 00:53:48,167
just too obvious?

832
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:52,138
They treated Park Gun Ho's case in such an absurd way...

833
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:55,748
because they don't want Lee Dae Chul's case to be reinvestigated.

834
00:53:55,748 --> 00:53:57,917
Like Kwon Jae Hong said,

835
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:00,377
there's no need to overthink it.

836
00:54:00,377 --> 00:54:03,187
Just drink and forget it. That's why I'm buying you drinks.

837
00:54:03,187 --> 00:54:05,257
So let's just drink.

838
00:54:06,357 --> 00:54:07,788
I don't agree...

839
00:54:07,788 --> 00:54:11,228
that we're mere minnows.

840
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:15,828
They can treat us this way...

841
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:20,167
because we don't stand up to their unreasonable behavior.

842
00:54:20,397 --> 00:54:23,567
We may not be able to change the whole world,

843
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:26,708
but I believe we can still change one person's life.

844
00:54:29,277 --> 00:54:32,277
Gosh, I think those girls are interested in me.

845
00:54:32,277 --> 00:54:33,717
My goodness.

846
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:36,388
They're interested in me, not you.

847
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:39,317
I... I like the girl on the right.

848
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:41,558
But they're too young.

849
00:54:41,687 --> 00:54:43,288
Go over and talk to them or something.

850
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:44,357
It's too early.

851
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:46,458
They should drink some more.

852
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,627
Once they get drunk...

853
00:54:47,928 --> 00:54:50,368
What are you two doing now?

854
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,237
- What?
- You really want to hit on girls?

855
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:56,507
Think about our situation.

856
00:54:57,737 --> 00:55:00,777
Forget it. You guys continue being oblivious.

857
00:55:03,348 --> 00:55:05,248
What would I say to you?

858
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:08,087
You wouldn't pay attention anyway.

859
00:55:10,317 --> 00:55:11,587
What's with him?

860
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:14,558
Drink. Drink up.

861
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,187
Does he think this is only hard for him?

862
00:55:17,187 --> 00:55:25,167
MEETING PLACE: INDOOR FOOD STALL

863
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:37,178
Hey.

864
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:40,147
Do you think I don't know this is unreasonable?

865
00:55:40,877 --> 00:55:43,417
It's the same with Man Gu and Ji Woong.

866
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:45,257
They know it too,

867
00:55:46,357 --> 00:55:47,687
but they're just putting up with it.

868
00:55:50,328 --> 00:55:52,897
At first, I thought...

869
00:55:53,498 --> 00:55:57,768
all police officers were fighters for justice.

870
00:55:59,098 --> 00:56:01,138
But this is just another society.

871
00:56:01,437 --> 00:56:03,167
Some are mean,

872
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:06,538
some deceive others to get ahead of them,

873
00:56:06,538 --> 00:56:10,348
and some are just downright selfish.

874
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,288
And some are stupid like Kang Do Chang.

875
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:19,658
"As cops, we can't do this."

876
00:56:20,217 --> 00:56:22,058
There's no such thing.

877
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:26,828
Don't hold cops to such high standards.

878
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:28,297
We're...

879
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:30,967
only human, after all.

880
00:56:37,777 --> 00:56:41,248
MEETING PLACE: INDOOR FOOD STALL

881
00:56:41,248 --> 00:56:42,848
We just do what we're told to do.

882
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:08,308
This is where Park Gun Ho first made a report to you, right?

883
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,507
Yes.

884
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:14,007
Now I get it.

885
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:17,777
Park Gun Ho wanted to tell us...

886
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:19,317
that this is where...

887
00:57:21,448 --> 00:57:23,748
we must start over.

888
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:51,210
Leading up to Ms. Yoon Ji Sun's death,

889
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:54,040
did anything suspicious happen?

890
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,440
Why are you asking about that out of the blue?

891
00:57:56,881 --> 00:58:00,210
We need to gather supplementary information.

892
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,250
I'm sorry to ask you to do this, but please try to remember.

893
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:04,991
I'm not sure.

894
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:06,790
Did she have a boyfriend?

895
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,321
Or a guy who chased after her, for example.

896
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:12,261
She did have a boyfriend.

897
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:16,531
I do recall overhearing them having an argument over the phone.

898
00:58:16,531 --> 00:58:18,301
But other than that, I don't really recall anything.

899
00:58:18,301 --> 00:58:22,500
Do you know who her boyfriend was?

900
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:27,540
Wasn't this covered in the original investigation?

901
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:30,210
Why ask her about those things again?

902
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,850
No, we didn't cover this back then.

903
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:34,980
Investigating the people around the victim is...

904
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,480
one of the first things you must do.

905
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
How come?

906
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,391
Has Lee Dae Chul confessed?

907
00:58:41,391 --> 00:58:42,391
Hello, sir.

908
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,261
I don't think it'll be easy to get his confession.

909
00:58:45,261 --> 00:58:47,060
How come? We have all the evidence.

910
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,730
I can't stop thinking that...

911
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:52,600
we don't have enough information on the people around Yoon Ji Sun.

912
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,870
I should meet them again and...

913
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,971
This case is...

914
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,770
all over the media at the moment.

915
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,241
They're praising us for catching the killer quickly.

916
00:59:03,241 --> 00:59:04,810
If we let this drag on,

917
00:59:05,181 --> 00:59:08,480
they'll question everything about the investigation.

918
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,980
I mean, we already have the culprit.

919
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,951
Why create a situation where we may get blamed?

920
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:16,221
You and Jang Jin Soo joined the force in the same year, right?

921
00:59:16,321 --> 00:59:18,861
- Yes, sir.
- He killed one of us.

922
00:59:18,861 --> 00:59:20,690
If we give a scumbag like him...

923
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,460
time to get out of this,

924
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,770
both of us will have to give up our police badges, don't you think?

925
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:28,471
Right?

926
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,310
You jerk. You scumbag!

927
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:37,241
I'd crush your skull right now if I could, you scumbag.

928
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,150
I... I didn't kill her.

929
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,750
I really didn't kill that female college student.

930
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,221
I mean, why would I kill her?

931
00:59:42,221 --> 00:59:44,250
We found your fingerprint as well as your blood...

932
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,051
on the weapon that killed Detective Jang Jin Soo.

933
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:48,491
If you didn't kill Yoon Ji Sun,

934
00:59:48,491 --> 00:59:50,620
then why did you kill Detective Jang Jin Soo?

935
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,161
You obviously killed him...

936
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:54,591
to cover up the murder, you jerk!

937
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,060
You lunatic!

938
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,161
That hurts! No!

939
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,971
Please... I didn't...

940
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,911
So no one investigated Yoon Ji Sun's boyfriend at the time.

941
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:10,810
Before Yoon Ji Sun died,

942
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:14,611
she shared her studio with a classmate.

943
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,020
That friend of hers probably has something to tell us.

944
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,491
Have you met that person?

945
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,290
I have.

946
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:24,790
But back then,

947
01:00:25,261 --> 01:00:28,301
I was already convinced that Lee Dae Chul was the killer,

948
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,931
so I interviewed the person just for formality's sake.

949
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:36,100
I have a feeling that we're off to a great start.

950
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:39,870
Are you being sarcastic?

951
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,580
This case is like a blank piece of paper.

952
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:44,440
To completely rewrite the story, it's better this way.

953
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:46,881
You have such a way with words.

954
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,451
CIVIL COMPLAINTS COUNSELING OFFICE

955
01:00:58,861 --> 01:01:02,031
Why was this on your desk, Detective Kwon?

956
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,770
There are two possibilities here.

957
01:01:05,471 --> 01:01:07,571
You either kept this intentionally...

958
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:11,071
or simply forgot to submit this piece of evidence...

959
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,341
to the evidence room.

960
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,411
I suppose we'll have to look further into this matter,

961
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:22,051
but I believe that the latter is right.

962
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,750
Initially, our main target was Detective Kang Do Chang.

963
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,491
However, we still have a long way to go...

964
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:30,460
to prove that he is indeed guilty of corruption.

965
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,631
I'd appreciate your help, Detective Kwon.

966
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,560
So you're saying...

967
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,031
I'm not asking you to make up something that never happened.

968
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:44,270
Just tell me what Detective Kang is up to.

969
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,710
I just want the truth.

970
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,341
All you need to do is keep me in the loop.

971
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,710
EVIDENCE

972
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,210
As for the conclusion on how this ended up...

973
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,821
in your hands, I'll wait to receive information that can satisfy me.

974
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:03,821
From what I remember, you and the late Ms. Yoon Ji Sun...

975
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:06,931
shared this studio for three years. Right?

976
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,431
Yes.

977
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:12,370
Then you probably know all the people...

978
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:15,940
who she spent the most time with. Her boyfriend, for example.

979
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,670
The thing is, Ji Sun was an introvert.

980
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,080
She rarely talked about herself to others.

981
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,051
I don't know any of her friends other than those in our department.

982
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,381
What did she usually draw?

983
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:30,181
She drew a lot of portraits.

984
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:32,891
Did she ever tell you about drawing a portrait of her boyfriend?

985
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:35,290
She might have drawn one for her boyfriend.

986
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:39,091
No, she always hired models for her portraits.

987
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:42,161
She refused even when her friends asked her to draw their portraits.

988
01:02:42,161 --> 01:02:44,361
She was very proud of her oeuvre.

989
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,031
Then do you remember anyone among those whom she hired...

990
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:48,600
as her models?

991
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,370
Around the time of the murder.

992
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,111
Gosh.

993
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,210
I'm not sure. It was too long ago.

994
01:02:55,341 --> 01:02:56,540
Please try to remember.

995
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,850
Mr. Oh will be here right after the meeting.

996
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,091
What kind of tea would you like?

997
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,591
Please don't worry about it.

998
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,790
Hey.

999
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,261
Get down. There's no one here.

1000
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:16,261
Gosh.

1001
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,670
Hey.

1002
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,301
You shouldn't underestimate Oh Jong Tae.

1003
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:26,411
If we mess with him,

1004
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:28,580
the higher-ups might pressure us even more.

1005
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:34,781
You're sure that Oh Jong Tae is linked to the case, right?

1006
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:37,020
Speaking with him will give us a better idea.

1007
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,290
There was something she was working on leading up to the incident.

1008
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,690
But I don't know who the model was.

1009
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:49,201
Ji Sun never showed me the portraits she was commissioned to draw.

1010
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,900
In some cases, her clients asked her to keep it confidential.

1011
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,040
Who were her clients that commissioned her?

1012
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,511
Rich people, of course. Those with a lot of egos.

1013
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,440
Are there any of her portraits still lying around here?

1014
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:06,681
Well, I'm not sure. I think her parents took most of them.

1015
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,051
Just a moment, please.

1016
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:12,650
Well...

1017
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,120
I don't think any of her finished work is here,

1018
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:18,261
but some of her sketches might still be here.

1019
01:04:21,761 --> 01:04:23,761
She always did sketches like these...

1020
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:26,031
prior to using paint.

1021
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,940
But these just show the outlines of the silhouettes,

1022
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,270
so you won't be able...

1023
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,571
to recognize the models from these sketches.

1024
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,341
So you think this portrait was done by the late Yoon Ji Sun?

1025
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,440
Is there a signature or anything like that at the bottom?

1026
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,580
I'm sure she didn't sign it.

1027
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:13,281
She was ashamed of...

1028
01:05:13,281 --> 01:05:15,080
being paid to draw these as a side gig.

1029
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,451
But all things aside,

1030
01:05:16,451 --> 01:05:17,980
a normal person...

1031
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:21,150
wouldn't want to hang a portrait drawn by the woman...

1032
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,391
whom he killed...

1033
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:26,361
in his own office. Am I wrong?

1034
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:28,230
That guy doesn't care about things like that.

1035
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,230
What? Do you know him?

1036
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,400
I see you often these days.

1037
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,040
What brings you here today?

1038
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:47,580

THE GOOD DETECTIVE

1040
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,431
I received a tip that Oh Jong Tae was dating Yoon Ji Sun at the time.

1041
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:08,801
She was very pretty.

1042
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,400
There's something I fear.

1043
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,770
Not catching the culprit.

1044
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,940
There's a culprit I must catch no matter what.

1045
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,011
Did you kill her?

1046
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:17,181
Why did you arrest Jo Seong Dae?

1047
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:19,580
For killing Park Gun Ho.

1048
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:22,181
- You scumbag.
- What's your problem, you jerk?

1049
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:23,780
There's someone who may be innocent.

1050
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,191
- Eun Hye.
- Are you confident?

1051
01:06:25,191 --> 01:06:26,490
I'm confident that I can prove it,

1052
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:27,691
and I can handle the consequences.

1053
01:06:27,691 --> 01:06:29,091
I deceived you.

1054
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:31,160
I actually killed someone.

1055
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,931
We're not trying to catch the culprit.

1056
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:34,731
We're trying to save a life.

1057
01:06:34,731 --> 01:06:35,731
Sir.

1058
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:38,131
Please save my dad.
